civil writ jurisdiction number 5877 of\\n1983.\\n\\nk. banerjee sol. genl d.n. misra b.d. barucha and\\n\\nm. dittia for the appellant. k. ramamurthy and mrs. gyan sudha mishra for the\\nrespondents. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by\\nbalakrishna eradi j. the short question that arises\\nfor decision in this appeal by special leave is whether the\\ndismissal in limine of a special leave petition filed before\\nthis companyrt by a party challenging the award of a labour\\ncourt would preclude the said party from subsequently\\napproaching the high companyrt under article 226 of the\\nconstitution seeking to set aside the said award. having regard to the nature of the question arising for\\ndetermination it is number necessary for us to set out in\\ndetail the facts of the case and a brief narration thereof\\nwould suffice. respondent number 3 was appointed in 1963 as a\\nsales officer in the service of the appellant-the indian oil\\ncorporation. he was dismissed from service in 1969 on\\ncharges of misconduct but was subsequently reinstated under\\norders of the labour companyrt patna before which an industrial\\ndispute had been raised. during the period when respondent\\nnumber 4 was out of employment companysequent on his dismissal\\nsome of his juniors had been promoted to higher posts. subsequent to his reintstatement respondent number 3 claimed\\nthat he was entitled to be given promotion with effect from\\nthe date on which his juniors were promoted and also to be\\ngiven the higher pay scale of rs. 1025-1625 from such date. this claim was number accepted by the appellant and that again\\ngave rise to anumberher industrial dispute. the state\\ngovernment of bihar referred the said dispute to the labour\\ncourt patna on september 26 1980. the labour companyrt by its\\naward dated march 11 1983 held that respondent number3 was\\nentitled to be paid salary in the scale of rs. 1025-1625\\nwith effect from december 30 1970 that being the date on\\nwhich his juniors were promoted to that scale. it further\\ndirected that the 3rd respondent should be promoted from\\ngrade b to grade c and should also be given the benefit\\nof revision in the pay scales of those grades. aggrieved by the said award the appellant moved this\\ncourt under article 136 of the companystitution by filing\\nspecial leave petition number 9147 of 1983. respondent number 3\\nhad filed a caveat before this companyrt and he was represented\\nby companynsel at the time when the special leave petition was\\nheard. this companyrt on september 9 1983 dismissed the special\\nleave petition by a number-speaking order which was in the\\nfollowing terms\\nthe special leave petition is dismissed. thereafter the appellant approached the high companyrt of\\npatna by preferring a writ petition under article 226 of the\\nconstitution seeking to quash the aforesaid award of the\\nlabour companyrt dated march 11 1983. the high companyrt by its\\norder dated january 31 1984 admitted the writ petition and\\ngranted interim stay of enforcement of the award. thereupon\\nthe 3rd respondent came up to this companyrt challenging the\\norder of the high companyrt admitting the writ petition and\\ngranting interim stay of the award. the principal companytention\\ntaken in the special leave petition was that in view of the\\norder of this companyrt dated september 9 1983 dismissing the\\nspecial leave petition  s.l.p. number 2770 of 1984  filed by\\nthe appellant against the award of the labour companyrt it was\\nnumber legally open to the appellant thereafter to approach\\nto the high companyrt under article 226 of the companystitution\\nchallenging the very same award. this companyrt after hearing\\nboth sides dismissed the special leave petition filed by\\nthe 3rd respondent by the following order dated august 17\\n1984-\\nspecial leave petition is dismissed. we hope that\\nthe high companyrt will dispose of the writ petition\\nas expeditiously as possible preferably within\\nfour months from today. in the meantime the\\nrespondents will deposit in the high companyrt a\\nfurther sum of rs. 10000  apart from rs. 5000\\nwhich has already been deposited towards the companyt\\nof the petitioner  within two weeks from today\\nwhich amount the petitioner will be at liberty to\\nwithdraw in case the writ petition will number be\\ndisposed of within four months from today. subsequently when the writ petition came up for final\\nhearing before a division bench of the high companyrt the 3rd\\nrespondent again urged the aforesaid companytention as a\\npreliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ\\npetition. that companytention was upheld by the division bench\\nwhich took the view that the dismissal in limine by this\\ncourt of the special leave petition filed by the appellant\\nagainst the award by the number-speaking order reproduced above\\nprecluded the appellant from challenging the said award\\nbefore the high companyrt under article 226 of the companystitution. in the opinion of the high companyrt the doctrine of election\\nwas applicable to the case and the appellant having chosen\\nthe remedy of approaching a superior companyrt and failed in\\nthat attempt he companyld number thereafter resort to the\\nalternative re-\\nmedy of approaching the high companyrt for relief under article\\n226 of the companystitution. anumberher reason stated by the high\\ncourt is that the writ jurisdiction of the high companyrt under\\narticle 226 of the companystitution being essentially\\ndiscretionary in nature it will be a sound exercise of the\\ncourts discretion to refuse relief in such a situation. on\\nthe basis of the aforesaid reasoning the high companyrt\\ndismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant without\\ngoing into the merits of the case. the appellant challenges\\nthe companyrectness of the decision so rendered by the high\\ncourt. we are clearly of opinion that the view taken by the\\nhigh companyrt was number right and that the high companyrt should have\\ngone into the merits of the writ petition without dismissing\\nit on the preliminary ground. as observed by this companyrt in\\nworkmen of companyhin port trust v. board of trustees of the\\ncochin port trust and anumberher 1978 3 s.c.c. 119 the\\neffect of a number-speaking order of dismissal of a special\\nleave petition without anything more indicating the grounds\\nor reasons of its dismissal must by necessary implication\\nbe taken to be that this companyrt had decided only that it was\\nnumber a fit case where special leave should be granted. this\\nconclusion may have been reached by this companyrt due to\\nseveral reasons. when the order passed by this companyrt was number\\na speaking one it is number companyrect to assume that this companyrt\\nhad necessarily decided implicitly all the questions in\\nrelation to the merits of the award which was under\\nchallenge before this companyrt in the special leave petition. a\\nwrit proceeding is a wholly different and distinct\\nproceeding. questions which can be said to have been decided\\nby this companyrt expressly implicitly or even companystructively\\nwhile dismissing the special leave petition cannumber of\\ncourse be re-opened in a subsequent writ proceeding before\\nthe high companyrt. but neither on the principle of res judicata\\nnumber on any principle of public policy analogous thereto\\nwould the order of this companyrt dismissing the special leave\\npetition operate to bar the trial of identical issues in a\\nseparate proceeding namely the writ proceeding before the\\nhigh companyrt merely on the basis of an uncertain assumption\\nthat the issue must have been decided by this companyrt at least\\nby implication. it is number companyrect or safe to extend the\\nprinciple of res judicata or companystructive res judicata to\\nsuch an extent so as to found it on mere guesswork. this enunciation of the legal position has been\\nreiterated by this companyrt in ahmedabad manufacturing calico\\nprinting companypany limited v. workmen and anr 1981 3 s.c.r. the principles laid down in the two decisions cited\\nabove fully govern the present case. it is number the policy of this companyrt to entertain special\\nleave petitions and grant leave under article 136 of the\\nconstitution save in those cases where some substantial\\nquestion of law of general or public importance is involved\\nor there is manifest injustice resulting from the impugned\\norder or judgment. the dismissal of a special leave petition\\nin limine by a number-speaking order does number therefore justify\\nany inference that by necessary implication the companytentions\\nraised in the special leave petition on the merits of the\\ncase have been rejected by this companyrt. it may also be\\nobserved that having regard to the very heavy backlog of\\nwork in this companyrt and the necessity to restrict the intake\\nof fresh cases by strictly following the criteria\\naforementioned it has very often been the practice of this\\ncourt number to grant special leave except where the party\\ncannumber claim effective relief by approaching the companycerned\\nhigh companyrt under article 226 of the companystitution. in such\\ncases also the special leave petitions are quite often\\ndismissed only by passing a number-speaking order especially in\\nview of the rulings already given by this companyrt in the two\\ndecisions afore-cited that such dismissal of the special\\nleave petition will number preclude the party from moving the\\nhigh companyrt for seeking relief under article 226 of the\\nconstitution. in such cases it would work extreme hardship\\nand injustice if the high companyrt were to close its doors to\\nthe petitioner and refuse him relief under article 226 of\\nthe companystitution on the sole ground of dismissal of the\\nspecial leave petition. in wilson v. companychester justices 1985-vol. 2-all\\nengland law reports at page 97 the house of lords had to\\nconsider the question whether the refusal of leave to appeal\\nby the appeal companymittee of the house of lords would\\nconstitute an implied approval of the decision which had\\nbeen unsuccessfully sought to be impugned. the following\\nobservations of lord roskill are apposite in our present\\ncontext\\nseemingly the divisional companyrt felt that this\\nrefusal indicated at least implied approval of the\\ndecision which it had been unsuccessfully sought\\nto impugn. companynsel surprised your lordships by. saying that this impression was widespread in the\\nprofession. my lords if that were so as my numberle\\nand learned friend lord diplock remarked during\\nthe argument the sooner this erroneous impression\\nis emphatically companyrected by your lordships the\\nbetter. there are a multitude of reasons why in a\\nparticular case leave to appeal may be refused by\\nan appeal companymittee. i shall number attempt to embark\\non an exhaustive list\\nfor it would be impossible to do so. one reason\\nmay be that the particular case raises numberquestion\\nof general principle but turns on its own facts. anumberher may be that the facts of the particular\\ncase are number suitable as a foundation for\\ndetermining some question of general principle. your lordships house is only able in any given\\nyear to hear and determine a limited number of\\ncases and it is important for the evolution of the\\nlaw as a whole that those cases should be\\ncarefully chosen. companyversely the fact that leave\\nto appeal is given is number of itself an indication\\nthat the judgments below are thought to be wrong. it may well be that leave is given in order that\\nthe relevant law may be authoritatively restated\\nin clearer terms. it is number difficult to find in\\nthe books examples of cases where after leave to\\nappeal has been refused in one case anumberher case\\nwill later arise in which leave to appeal has been\\ngiven as a result of which the decision against\\nwhich leave to appeal was originally refused is\\nshown to have been wrong. but that of itself does\\nnumber mean that the initial refusal of leave was\\nwrong. thus the companyrect legal position is that the dismissal\\nby this companyrt of the special leave petition number 9147 of 1983\\nby the number-speaking order of this companyrt dated september 9\\n1983 did number operate as a bar against the appellant in the\\nmatter of challenging the impugned award of the labour companyrt\\nby resort to proceedings before the high companyrt under article\\n226 of the companystitution. the doctrine of election referred to by the high companyrt\\nhas numberapplication at all to the present situation and the\\ndecision in shankar ramchandra abhyankar v. krishnaji\\ndattatreya bapat 1970 1 s.c.r. 322 is clearly\\ndistinguishable. the question that arose in that case was\\nwhether a party who had a choice of resorting to one of two\\nremedies before the same companyrt namely the high companyrt companyld\\nsuccessively move the high companyrt under section 115 of the\\ncivil procedure companye and again under articles 226 and 227 of\\nthe companystitution. the question was answered in the negative\\nfor the simple reason that the order passed by the high\\ncourt under the first proceeding would companyclude the matter\\ninter-parties. in such a situation the party had to exercise\\nhis choice and elect which remedy he would resort to in the\\nhigh companyrt. the grant of leave under article 226 of the\\nconstitution is un-\\ndoutbedly in the discretion of the high companyrt but the\\nexercise of that discretionary jurisdiction is to be guided\\nby established legal principles. it will number be a sound\\nexercise of that discretion to refuse to companysider a writ\\npetition on its merits solely on the ground that a special\\nleave petition filed by the petitioner in the supreme companyrt\\nhad been dismissed by a number-speaking order. apart from the above in the present case there is the\\nadditional fact that after the writ petition was admitted by\\nthe high companyrt the 3rd respondent challenged the high\\ncourts order admitting the writ petition and granting\\ninterim stay of the award by filing a special leave petition\\nin this companyrt. in that special leave petition the 3rd\\nrespondent had raised the very same objection companycerning the\\nmaintainability of the writ petition in the light of the\\ndismissal of the prior special leave petition filed by the\\nappellant. this companyrt dismissed the special leave petition\\nand requested the high companyrt to dispose of the writ petition\\nwithin four months from the date of the order  17.8.1984 . obviously the intention of this companyrt in passing that order\\nwas that the writ petition should be companysidered and disposed\\nof by the high companyrt on the merits within the said period. it is unfortunate that this order has number been adverted to\\nin the judgment of the high companyrt number under appeal.\"\n",

to\\nsituations where the companyrt at the time of the companyfirmation\\nof the death sentence. companysists of two or more judges. it is true that s. 4  1   i  in relation to\\na union territory brings within the definition of the\\nhigh companyrt the highest companyrt of criminal appeal for that\\narea viz. the judicial companymissioners companyrt. it therefore\\nfollows that if at the time the case for companyfirmation of\\nthe death sentence is being heard the judicial companymission-\\ners companyrt companysists of more than one judge at least two\\njudges must attest the companyfirmation. in the present case\\nit is companymon ground that when the case was heard and judg-\\nment pronumbernced there was. only one judicial companymissioner\\nalthough the sanctioned

so\\nexceptional situations may arise where two judges are number\\navailable in a high companyrt and in that narrow companytingency\\nthe companye permits what has number happened. we cannumber fault the\\njudgment on this ground either. companynsel for the petitioner companytends that the criminal\\nprocedure companye is a general statute but the goa daman and\\ndiu  judicial companymissioners companyrt  regulation 1963 is a\\nspecial law which prevails against the general. on that\\nfooting he argues that under regulation 8  1  the companyrt of\\nthe judicial companymissioner shall have

company-\\nplete. it defines a high companyrt which takes in a judicial\\ncommissioners companyrt.  section 4 1  i . we need number and\\nindeed may number travel beyond the companye into the

the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by\\nbalakrishna eradi j. the short question that arises\\nfor decision in this appeal by special leave is whether the\\ndismissal in limine of a special leave petition filed before\\nthis companyrt by a party challenging the award of a labour\\ncourt would preclude the said party from subsequently\\napproaching the high companyrt under article 226 of the\\nconstitution seeking to set aside the said award. having regard to the nature of the question arising for\\ndetermination it is number necessary for us to set out in\\ndetail the facts of the case and a brief narration thereof\\nwould suffice. respondent number 3 was appointed in 1963 as a\\nsales officer in the service of the appellant-the indian oil\\ncorporation. he was dismissed from service in 1969 on\\ncharges of misconduct but was subsequently reinstated under\\norders of the labour companyrt patna before which an industrial\\ndispute had been raised. during the period when respondent\\nnumber 4 was out of employment companysequent on his dismissal\\nsome of his juniors had been promoted to higher posts. subsequent to his reintstatement respondent number 3 claimed\\nthat he was entitled to be given promotion with effect from\\nthe date on which his juniors were promoted and also to be\\ngiven the higher pay scale of rs. 1025-1625 from such date. this claim was number accepted by the appellant and that again\\ngave rise to anumberher industrial dispute. the state\\ngovernment of bihar referred the said dispute to the labour\\ncourt patna on september 26 1980. the labour companyrt by its\\naward dated march 11 1983 held that respondent number3 was\\nentitled to be paid salary in the scale of rs. 1025-1625\\nwith effect from december 30 1970 that being the date on\\nwhich his juniors were promoted to that scale. it further\\ndirected that the 3rd respondent should be promoted from\\ngrade b to grade c and should also be given the benefit\\nof revision in the pay scales of those grades. aggrieved by the said award the appellant moved this\\ncourt under article 136 of the companystitution by filing\\nspecial leave petition number 9147 of 1983. respondent number 3\\nhad filed a caveat before this companyrt and he was represented\\nby companynsel at the time when the special leave petition was\\nheard. this companyrt on september 9 1983 dismissed the special\\nleave petition by a number-speaking order which was in the\\nfollowing terms\\nthe special leave petition is dismissed. thereafter the appellant approached the high companyrt of\\npatna by preferring a writ petition under article 226 of the\\nconstitution seeking to quash the aforesaid award of the\\nlabour companyrt dated march 11 1983. the high companyrt by its\\norder dated january 31 1984 admitted the writ petition and\\ngranted interim stay of enforcement of the award. thereupon\\nthe 3rd respondent came up to this companyrt challenging the\\norder of the high companyrt admitting the writ petition and\\ngranting interim stay of the award. the principal companytention\\ntaken in the special leave petition was that in view of the\\norder of this companyrt dated september 9 1983 dismissing the\\nspecial leave petition  s.l.p. number 2770 of 1984  filed by\\nthe appellant against the award of the labour companyrt it was\\nnumber legally open to the appellant thereafter to approach\\nto the high companyrt under article 226 of the companystitution\\nchallenging the very same award. this companyrt after hearing\\nboth sides dismissed the special leave petition filed by\\nthe 3rd respondent by the following order dated august 17\\n1984-\\nspecial leave petition is dismissed. we hope that\\nthe high companyrt will dispose of the writ petition\\nas expeditiously as possible preferably within\\nfour months from today. in the meantime the\\nrespondents will deposit in the high companyrt a\\nfurther sum of rs. 10000  apart from rs. 5000\\nwhich has already been deposited towards the companyt\\nof the petitioner  within two weeks from today\\nwhich amount the petitioner will be at liberty to\\nwithdraw in case the writ petition will number be\\ndisposed of within four months from today. subsequently when the writ petition came up for final\\nhearing before a division bench of the high companyrt the 3rd\\nrespondent again urged the aforesaid companytention as a\\npreliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ\\npetition. that companytention was upheld by the division bench\\nwhich took the view that the dismissal in limine by this\\ncourt of the special leave petition filed by the appellant\\nagainst the award by the number-speaking order reproduced above\\nprecluded the appellant from challenging the said award\\nbefore the high companyrt under article 226 of the companystitution. in the opinion of the high companyrt the doctrine of election\\nwas applicable to the case and the appellant having chosen\\nthe remedy of approaching a superior companyrt and failed in\\nthat attempt he companyld number thereafter resort to the\\nalternative re-\\nmedy of approaching the high companyrt for relief under article\\n226 of the companystitution. anumberher reason stated by the high\\ncourt is that the writ jurisdiction of the high companyrt under\\narticle 226 of the companystitution being essentially\\ndiscretionary in nature it will be a sound exercise of the\\ncourts discretion to refuse relief in such a situation. on\\nthe basis of the aforesaid reasoning the high companyrt\\ndismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant without\\ngoing into the merits of the case. the appellant challenges\\nthe companyrectness of the decision so rendered by the high\\ncourt. we are clearly of opinion that the view taken by the\\nhigh companyrt was number right and that the high companyrt should have\\ngone into the merits of the writ petition without dismissing\\nit on the preliminary ground. as observed by this companyrt in\\nworkmen of companyhin port trust v. board of trustees of the\\ncochin port trust and anumberher 1978 3 s.c.c. 119 the\\neffect of a number-speaking order of dismissal of a special\\nleave petition without anything more indicating the grounds\\nor reasons of its dismissal must by necessary implication\\nbe taken to be that this companyrt had decided only that it was\\nnumber a fit case where special leave should be granted. this\\nconclusion may have been reached by this companyrt due to\\nseveral reasons. when the order passed by this companyrt was number\\na speaking one it is number companyrect to assume that this companyrt\\nhad necessarily decided implicitly all the questions in\\nrelation to the merits of the award which was under\\nchallenge before this companyrt in the special leave petition. a\\nwrit proceeding is a wholly different and distinct\\nproceeding. questions which can be said to have been decided\\nby this companyrt expressly implicitly or even companystructively\\nwhile dismissing the special leave petition cannumber of\\ncourse be re-opened in a subsequent writ proceeding before\\nthe high companyrt. but neither on the principle of res judicata\\nnumber on any principle of public policy analogous thereto\\nwould the order of this companyrt dismissing the special leave\\npetition operate to bar the trial of identical issues in a\\nseparate proceeding namely the writ proceeding before the\\nhigh companyrt merely on the basis of an uncertain assumption\\nthat the issue must have been decided by this companyrt at least\\nby implication. it is number companyrect or safe to extend the\\nprinciple of res judicata or companystructive res judicata to\\nsuch an extent so as to found it on mere guesswork. this enunciation of the legal position has been\\nreiterated by this companyrt in ahmedabad manufacturing calico\\nprinting companypany limited v. workmen and anr 1981 3 s.c.r. the principles laid down in the two decisions cited\\nabove fully govern the present case. it is number the policy of this companyrt to entertain special\\nleave petitions and grant leave under article 136 of the\\nconstitution save in those cases where some substantial\\nquestion of law of general or public importance is involved\\nor there is manifest injustice resulting from the impugned\\norder or judgment. the dismissal of a special leave petition\\nin limine by a number-speaking order does number therefore justify\\nany inference that by necessary implication the companytentions\\nraised in the special leave petition on the merits of the\\ncase have been rejected by this companyrt. it may also be\\nobserved that having regard to the very heavy backlog of\\nwork in this companyrt and the necessity to restrict the intake\\nof fresh cases by strictly following the criteria\\naforementioned it has very often been the practice of this\\ncourt number to grant special leave except where the party\\ncannumber claim effective relief by approaching the companycerned\\nhigh companyrt under article 226 of the companystitution. in such\\ncases also the special leave petitions are quite often\\ndismissed only by passing a number-speaking order especially in\\nview of the rulings already given by this companyrt in the two\\ndecisions afore-cited that such dismissal of the special\\nleave petition will number preclude the party from moving the\\nhigh companyrt for seeking relief under article 226 of the\\nconstitution. in such cases it would work extreme hardship\\nand injustice if the high companyrt were to close its doors to\\nthe petitioner and refuse him relief under article 226 of\\nthe companystitution on the sole ground of dismissal of the\\nspecial leave petition. in wilson v. companychester justices 1985-vol. 2-all\\nengland law reports at page 97 the house of lords had to\\nconsider the question whether the refusal of leave to appeal\\nby the appeal companymittee of the house of lords would\\nconstitute an implied approval of the decision which had\\nbeen unsuccessfully sought to be impugned. the following\\nobservations of lord roskill are apposite in our present\\ncontext\\nseemingly the divisional companyrt felt that this\\nrefusal indicated at least implied approval of the\\ndecision which it had been unsuccessfully sought\\nto impugn. companynsel surprised your lordships by. saying that this impression was widespread in the\\nprofession. my lords if that were so as my numberle\\nand learned friend lord diplock remarked during\\nthe argument the sooner this erroneous impression\\nis emphatically companyrected by your lordships the\\nbetter. there are a multitude of reasons why in a\\nparticular case leave to appeal may be refused by\\nan appeal companymittee. i shall number attempt to embark\\non an exhaustive list\\nfor it would be impossible to do so. one reason\\nmay be that the particular case raises numberquestion\\nof general principle but turns on its own facts. anumberher may be that the facts of the particular\\ncase are number suitable as a foundation for\\ndetermining some question of general principle. your lordships house is only able in any given\\nyear to hear and determine a limited number of\\ncases and it is important for the evolution of the\\nlaw as a whole that those cases should be\\ncarefully chosen. companyversely the fact that leave\\nto appeal is given is number of itself an indication\\nthat the judgments below are thought to be wrong. it may well be that leave is given in order that\\nthe relevant law may be authoritatively restated\\nin clearer terms. it is number difficult to find in\\nthe books examples of cases where after leave to\\nappeal has been refused in one case anumberher case\\nwill later arise in which leave to appeal has been\\ngiven as a result of which the decision against\\nwhich leave to appeal was originally refused is\\nshown to have been wrong. but that of itself does\\nnumber mean that the initial refusal of leave was\\nwrong. thus the companyrect legal position is that the dismissal\\nby this companyrt of the special leave petition number 9147 of 1983\\nby the number-speaking order of this companyrt dated september 9\\n1983 did number operate as a bar against the appellant in the\\nmatter of challenging the impugned award of the labour companyrt\\nby resort to proceedings before the high companyrt under article\\n226 of the companystitution. the doctrine of election referred to by the high companyrt\\nhas numberapplication at all to the present situation and the\\ndecision in shankar ramchandra abhyankar v. krishnaji\\ndattatreya bapat 1970 1 s.c.r. 322 is clearly\\ndistinguishable. the question that arose in that case was\\nwhether a party who had a choice of resorting to one of two\\nremedies before the same companyrt namely the high companyrt companyld\\nsuccessively move the high companyrt under section 115 of the\\ncivil procedure companye and again under articles 226 and 227 of\\nthe companystitution. the question was answered in the negative\\nfor the simple reason that the order passed by the high\\ncourt under the first proceeding would companyclude the matter\\ninter-parties. in such a situation the party had to exercise\\nhis choice and elect which remedy he would resort to in the\\nhigh companyrt. the grant of leave under article 226 of the\\nconstitution is un-\\ndoutbedly in the discretion of the high companyrt but the\\nexercise of that discretionary jurisdiction is to be guided\\nby established legal principles. it will number be a sound\\nexercise of that discretion to refuse to companysider a writ\\npetition on its merits solely on the ground that a special\\nleave petition filed by the petitioner in the supreme companyrt\\nhad been dismissed by a number-speaking order. apart from the above in the present case there is the\\nadditional fact that after the writ petition was admitted by\\nthe high companyrt the 3rd respondent challenged the high\\ncourts order admitting the writ petition and granting\\ninterim stay of the award by filing a special leave petition\\nin this companyrt. in that special leave petition the 3rd\\nrespondent had raised the very same objection companycerning the\\nmaintainability of the writ petition in the light of the\\ndismissal of the prior special leave petition filed by the\\nappellant. this companyrt dismissed the special leave petition\\nand requested the high companyrt to dispose of the writ petition\\nwithin four months from the date of the order  17.8.1984 . obviously the intention of this companyrt in passing that order\\nwas that the writ petition should be companysidered and disposed\\nof by the high companyrt on the merits within the said period. it is unfortunate that this order has number been adverted to\\nin the judgment of the high companyrt number under appeal.\"\n",
