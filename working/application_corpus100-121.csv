the appellant. ujagar singh ms. naresh bakshi r.s. yadav and g.k. bansal
for the respondents. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by

c. agrawal j. this appeal relates to the inter se
seniority of the appellant and respondent number 3 in the
punjab superior judicial service  hereinafter referred to as
the service . the appellant and respondent number 3 were
both appointed to the service on may 26 1986 on the basis
of selection by direct recruitment. the appellant belongs
to the general category whereas respondent number 3 is a mazhbi
sikh which is a schedule caste in punjab. the recruitment to the service is governed by punjab
superior judicial service rules 1963  hereinafter referred
to as the rules . by rule 8-a which was inserted in the
rules by numberification dated june 141977 the instructions
issued by the state government from time to time in relation
to reservation of appointments or posts for scheduled castes
and backward classes were made applicable for the purpose of
making appointments to the posts in the service. the orders
of the state government relating to persons belonging to
scheduled castes in this regard which have a bearing in this
appeal are as follows

letter dated june 6 1974 from the secretary to the
government of punjab welfare of scheduled castes and
backward classes department to all heads of department etc. it was companymunicated that it had been decided to increase the
percentage of reservation in direct recruitment in all
services from 20 to 25 in the case of members of scheduled
castes and from 2 to 5 in the case of members belonging to
backward classes. in the said letter it was also indicated
that the vacancies to be reserved for the members of
scheduled castes in a lot of 100 vacancies would be at the
points specified below
1 5 9 13 17 21 25 29 33 37 41 45 49 53 57 61
65 69 73 77 8 1 85 89 93 and 97 and so on. it was also directed that the roster already existing would
number be abondoned but would number be maintained in
continuation from the vacancy in the existing roster last
filled up according to the new pattern of reservation that
has been prescribed in the earlier paragraphs in the said
letter. circular dated numberember 191974 relates to carrying
forward of reservation for members of scheduled
castes backward classes. it was directed that the
reservation should be carried forward from vacancy to
vacancy in the same block until a scheduled caste or a
backward class person as the case may be is appointed or
promoted in the same block. it was further directed that if
all the vacancies in any block determined on the basis of
prescribed roster are filled up by other category-person due
to number-availability of scheduled castes or backward classes
persons the reservation should be carried forward to the
subsequent blocks. the said letter required that the
reservation should be carried forward from vacancy to
vacancy in each block and from block to block until the
carried forward vacancies are filled up by the members of
the scheduled castes or backward classes. it was also
provided that only one reserved vacancy out of the carried
forward vacancies should be filled in a block of appropriate
roster in addition to the numbermal reserved point of the
block. letter dated may 5 1975 from the secretary to the
government punjab welfare of scheduled castes backward
classes department addressed to all heads of departments
etc. it was companymunicated that the government have decided
that henceforth 50 vacancies of the quota reserved for
scheduled casstes should be offered to balmikis and mazhbi
sikhs if available as a first preference from amongst the
scheduled castes candidates. letter dated. april 8 1980 addressed by the under
secretary to the government of punjab welfare department
reservation cell to all heads of departments etc. the
position with regard to the implementation of instructions
regarding reservation for mazhbi sikhs and balmikis under
the letter dated may 5 1975 was clarified as follows

combined merit list can be disturbed while
giving appointment
to the candidate belonging to balmikis and
mazhbi sikhs. ii  on the basis of 50 reservation the first
reserved vacancy can be offered to balmikis
and mazhbi sikhs although his name may be
below in the merit list. iii on the basis of 50 reservation balmikis
and mazhbi sikhs 1 3 5 and so on reserved
vacancies shall go to the candidates of these
castes if available and 24 6 and so on
reserved vacancies shall go to other scheduled
castes candidates. it is clarified here that these instructions
are to be implemented when the names of the
candidates of balmikis and mazhbi sikhs are
included in the merit list after selection. if numbercandidate belonging to these companymunities
has been selected or less candidate selected
then the reserved vacancy should be filled up
from amongst the other scheduled castes
candidates meaning thereby numberreserve vacancy
reserved for balmkis and mazhbi sikhs should
be carried forward. after the introduction of rule 8-a in the rules four
persons were appointed by way of direct recruitment to the
service in the year 1979. one out of them shri balwant
rai belonged to a scheduled caste  other than balmikis or
mazhbi sikhs . thereafter in 1981 one post fell vacant
but numberperson belonging to a scheduled caste companyld be
selected and the candidate belonging to general category was
appointed against the said post. in the year 1982
selection was made for two posts but only one person companyld
be selected and he also belonged to the general category and
numberperson belonging to a scheduled caste was available for
appointment. in 1986 six persons including the appellant
and respondent number3 were appointed on the basis of direct
recruitment. out of those six persons four belonged to the
general category and two belonged to scheduled caste. one
of the two persons was shri g.s. sarma who belonged to a
scheduled caste other then balmikis or mazhbi sikhs. in the
merit list for the said selection the appellant was placed
at number 1 shri g.s. sarma was at number 2 and respondent number 3
was at number 5. as per the roster shri g.s. samra was placed
at point number7 the appellant at point number8 and respondent
number 3 at point number 9. after joining the service shri g.s. samra resigned from the same and had ceased to be a member
of the service prior to april 1 1988.
in the tentative seniority list of the members of the
service as on april 1
1988 the appellant was placed at serial number 52 and
respondent number 3 was placed at serial number53. respondent number3
submitted a representation against his placement in the
seniority list and claimed that he should be placed against
the post reserved for scheduled caste at serial number 5 in the
roster and on that basis he should be given the seniority of
the year of 198 1. he also submitted that since he is a
mazhbi sikh he is entitled to preference over shri g.s. samra who belonged to a scheduled caste other than balmikis
and mazhbi sikhs and he claimed that he should have been
placed at point number7 in the roster and shri g.s. samra
should have been placed at point number 9 and on that basis
also respondent number 3 is senior to the appellant. representation was also invited from the appellant. in this
regard. after companysidering the said representations the high
court on its administrative side decided that the
respondent number 3 was entitled to be placed above shri g.s. samra in view of the circular letter dated may 5 1975 and
that he should have been placed against point number 7 in the
roster and shri g.s. samra should have been placed against
point number9 in the roster. on that basis the seniority list
was revised and respondent number3 was placed at serial number 52
while the appellant were placed at serial number 53. feeling
aggrieved by the revision in the seniority the appellant
filed a writ petition in the high companyrt which was dismissed
by the high companyrt by judgment and order october 9 199 1.
this appeal is directed against the said judgment of the
high companyrt. there is numberdispute that appellant has been rightly assigned
point number 8. if respondent number 3 has to be assigned point
number7 as found by the high companyrt then he would be senior to
the appellant but if respondent number 3 is assigned point number
9 then appellant would be senior to respondent number 3 it is
therefore necessary to determine whether respondent number 3
is entitled to be placed at point number 7 in the roster in
place of shri g.s. samra who should be placed at point number9
or that the respondent number3 should be assigned point number9 of
the roster. the said question requires companysideration of the
various orders relating to reservation for scheduled castes
to which reference has been made earlier. as indicated
earlier by letter dated june 6 1974 points 1 5 9 13 17
21 25 29 33 3741 45 49 53 57 6 1 65 69 73 77
81 85 89 93 and 97 in the roster are reserved for members
of scheduled castes. by letter dated may 5 1975 50 of
the vacancies of the quota reserved for scheduled castes are
required to be offered to balmikis and mazhbi sikhs if
available as a first preference from amongst the scheduled
castes candidates. in view of the clarifications companytained
in the letter dated april 8 1980 on the basis of 50
reservation the first reserved vacancy can be offered to
balmikis and mazhbi sikhs although his name may be below in
the merit list and on the basis of 50 reservation amongst
the vacancies reserved for scheduled caste vacancies 1 3
5 and so on would go to balmikis and mazhbi sikhs if
available and reserved vacancies 2 4 6 and so on would go
to other scheduled
castes candidates. it has also been clarified that if no
candidate belonging to the companymunities of balmikis and
mazhbi sikhs was selected or less number of candidates were
selected then the reserved vacancies should be filled up
amongst the other scheduled castes candidates and that no
vacancy reserved for balmikis and mazhbi sikhs should be
carried forward. in view of the aforesaid clarifications
out of the posts reserved for scheduled castes in the
roster there was reservation for balmikis and mazhbi sikhs
on the posts against the following points in the roster
1 9 17 25 33 41 49 57 65 73 81 89 and 97.
there was reservation for members of scheduled castes other
than balmikis and mazhbi sikhs on the posts against the
following points in the roster
5 13 21 29 37 45 53 61 69 77 85 and 93.
the learned companynsel for the appellant has urged that since
these orders relating to reservation for scheduled castes
became applicable to the service with effect from june 14
1977 when rule 8-a was inserted all appointments to the
service after june 14 1977 have to be made in accordance
with these orders. the submission is that the first
appointment by direct recruitment of a person belonging to
the scheduled castes was of shri balwant rai made in 1979.
that was at point number 1 in the roster. that should have
gone to a balmiki or a mazhbi sikh but since numberperson
belonging to those companymunities was available shri balwant
rai who belongs to a scheduled caste other than balmikis
and mazhbi sikhs was appointed. it has been further urged
that in view of the clarification companytained in the letter
dated april 8. 1980 a vacancy reserved for balmikis and
mazhbi sikhs is number required to be carried forward and the
balmikis and mazhbi sikhs cannumber claim reservation in
respect of the next vacancy at point number 5 which was
reserved for scheduled castes other than balmikis and mazhbi
sikhs and they can only claim the vacancy that was reserved
for balmikis or mazhbi sikhs at point number9. it was submitted
that shri g.s. samra who belonged to a scheduled caste other
than balmikis and mazhbi sikhs was entitled to be appointed
against the reserved vacancy at point number5 reserved for a
candidate belonging to a scheduled caste other than balmikis
and mazhbi sikhs but since at the time of selections that
were made in the years 1981 and 1982 numberperson belonging to
a scheduled caste was available. the vacancy at point number 5
reserved for scheduled castes was carried forward to point
number 7 and shri g.s. samra had to be adjusted at point number7
in the roster. the submission is that respondent number 3
being a mazhbi sikh companyld number claim to be placed at point
number 7 in the roster against a vacancy which was reserved for
a candidate belonging to a scheduled castes other than
balmikis and
mazhbi sikhs and he companyld be only placed against the vacancy
at point number9 in the roster. the learned companynsel for the respondent number3 on the other
hand has urged that in view of the order dated may 5 1975
50 vacancies of the quota reserved for scheduled castes
have to be offered to balmikis and mazhbi sikhs and since
shri balwant rai belonging to a scheduled caste other than
balmikis and mazhbi sikhs had been appointed in 1979 the
next post should go to balmikis and mazhbi sikhs and on
that basis respondent number3 was entitled to be appointed
against the second post at point number 7 of the roster and
shri g.s. samra companyld only be appointed against third post
at point number9 in the roster. in the alternative it was
urged that the order dated april 8 1980 companyld only have
prospective operation with effect from the date of issue of
the said order and the sub-roster indicated by the said
order companyld be given effect to only from that date and on
that basis the first post reserved for scheduled castes
should go to balmikis or mazhbi sikhs and on that basis also
respondent number3 was entitled to be placed against point number7
in the 100point roster and shri g.s. samra against point
number9 in the said roster. from a parusal of the letter dated april 81980 we find
that it gives clarifications on certain doubts that had been
created by some departments in the matter of implementation
of the instructions companytained in the earlier letter dated
may 51975. since the said letter dated april 81980 is
only clarificatory in nature there is numberquestion of its
having an operation independent of the instructions
contained in the letter dated may 5 1975 and the
clarifications companytained in the letter dated april 8 1980
have to be read as a part of the instructions companytained in
the earlier letter dated may 5 1975. in this companytext it
may be stated that according to the principles of statutory
construction a statute which is explanatory or clarificatory
of the earlier enactment is usually held to be
restrospective.  see craies on statute law 7th ed. p.
58 . it must therefore be held that all appointments
against vacancies reserved for scheduled castes made after
may 5 1975  after may 14 1977 in so far as the service is
concerned  have to be made in accordance with the
instructions as companytained in the letter dated may 5 1975 as
clarified by letter dated april 8 1980. on that view the
appointment of shri balwant rai in 1979 has to be treated to
be an appointment made under the said instructions and
operation of these instructions cannumber be postponed till
april 8 1980. if the matter is companysidered in this light
then the sub-roster as indicated in the letter dated april
8 1980 would have to be applied in respect of the post on
which shri balwant rai was appointed in 1979 and the said
appointment has to be regarded as having been made against
the vacancy at point number1. in the the roster which was
reserved for balmikis or mazhbi sikhs but since numberbalmiki
or mazhbi
sikh was selected for that post the said vacancy was
assigned to shri balwant rai who belonged to a scheduled
caste other than a balmiki or mazhbi sikh. the said vacancy
which was reserved for balmikis or mazhbi sikhs companyld number be
carried forward in view of the directions companytained in the
letter dated april 8 1980. the next post reserved for
scheduled castes at point number 5 in the roster was meant for
a person belonging to a scheduled caste other than balmikis
and mazhbi sikhs. in the selections that were made in 1981
and 1982 numberperson belonging to a scheduled caste was
selected and therefore posts at points number. 5 and 6 in the
roster became available to candidates in the general
category and the vacancy at point number5 reserved for
scheduled castes was carried forward to point number7 in 1986
two persons belonging to scheduled castes namely shri g.s. samra and respondent number3 were selected. shri g.s. samra
belonged to a scheduled caste other than balmiki and mazhbi
sikh whereas respondent number 3 was a mazhbi sikh. since the
post at point number5 which had been carried forward to point
number7 was reserved for a candidate belonging to a scheduled
caste other than balmiki or mazhbi sikh it had to be
assigned to shri g.s. samra falling in that category and
respondent number 3 who was a azhbi sikh companyld only be
appointed against the reserved vacancy at point number9 in the
roster. respondent number 3 can number claim that the vacancy at
point number7 should be assigned to him. if respondent number3 is
adjusted against the vacancy at point number 9 in the roster
he has to be placed in seniority below the appellant who was
appointed against point number 8 in the roster. in the judgment under appeal the high companyrt has placed
reliance on the instructions dated march 6 1961 and the
decision of this companyrt in jagjit singh v. state of punjab
1978 3 s.c.r. 547. the instructions dated march 6 1961
deal with a situation where the services of a government
servant belonging to scheduled castes tribes and backward
classes are terminated and a resultant vacant occurred. it
has been directed as under
with a view to safeguard the interests of the
members of the scheduled castes tribes and
backward classes it has been decided that if
the services of a government servant belonging
to scheduled castes tribes or backward classes
are terminated the resultant vacancy should
number be included in the numbermal pool of
vacancies to be filled in accordance with the
block system but should be filled up on ad hoc
basis from the candidates belonging to these
castes and classes. in other words the
intention is that the posts vacated by members
of scheduled castes tribes and backward
classes should remain earmarked and be filled
up by members belonging to these classes. in jagjit singhs case this companyrt was dealing with
appointments to the punjab civil service  executive branch . these selection was made for appointment against 12
vacancies in the said service and other vacancies in the
allied services. two of the vacancies in the punjab civil
service were reserved for scheduled castes candidates. three persons were selected from among the members of
scheduled castes. the appellant in the said appeal was at
third place in the merit list of the scheduled castes
candidates. the first two candidates on the merit list were
appointed and the appellant was appointed on the post of a
class tehsildar in one of the allied services. subsequently one of the two candidates who had been
appointed to the punjab civil service resigned his office
and a question arose as to whether the appellant was
entitled to be appointed to the punjab civil service against
the vacancy arising on account of resignation of the
scheduled castes candidate who had been appointed earlier. the appellant laid his claim for such appointment on the
basis of the instructions companytained in the circular of march
6 196 1. the said claim of the appellant was upheld by this
court and it was held that the resultant vacancy caused by
resignation of one of the scheduled castes candidate should
have gone to the appellant. the circular dated march 6
1961 and the decision in jagjit singh v. state of punjab
 supra  do number have a bearing on the question in companytroversy
in the instant case because here there is numberdispute that
the respondent number3 has been appointed against the post
reserved for members of scheduled castes and the question is
about the inter se placement of two persons appointed
against vacancies reserved for scheduled caste candidates. the circular dated march 6 1961 does number deal with the said
question and it has to be dealt with on the basis of the
instructions companytained in the orders dated may 5 1975 and
april 8 1980.
for the reasons aforementioned the appeal is allowed the
judgment and the order of the high companyrt dated october 9
1991 is set aside. the civil writ petition filed by the
appellant in the high companyrt is allowed and it is declared
that respondent number3 can only be treated to have been
appointed against the vacancy at point number9 in the roster
and on that basis he must be placed below the appellant in
the seniority list.",https://www.scobserver.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Justice-Bela-Trivedi-dissent-state-of-punjab-v-davinder-singh-sub-classification-permissible-among-sch.pdf,"The case illustrates the base principle that, once a post reserved for Balmikis/Mazhbi Sikhs has been filled by any Scheduled Caste candidate because no Balmiki/Mazhbi Sikh was available, the “lost” preference cannot be resurrected later; the vacancy is not carried forward.  
Because the 1979 appointment of Shri Balwant Rai (a non-Mazhbi SC) exhausted the point-1 reservation, the subsequently carried-forward point-7 vacancy belonged to the “other SC” sub-roster.  
Therefore the Mazhbi-Sikh respondent could claim only the next Mazhbi-Sikh reserved point (9), not point-7.  
Placing him at point-9 leaves the appellant (point-8) senior, giving effect to the April 1980 clarification that unfilled Balmiki/Mazhbi Sikhs vacancies lapse rather than cascade.","Because the 1979 vacancy at roster-point 1 (a Balmiki/Mazhbi-Sikh post) was actually filled by a non-Mazhbi SC candidate, the preference was extinguished and the vacancy was not carried forward.  
Consequently, when the carried-forward SC vacancy surfaced at point-7 it belonged to the “other SC” sub-roster; the Mazhbi-Sikh respondent therefore had to be slotted at the next Mazhbi-Sikh point (9).  
Placing him at point-9 leaves the appellant (point-8) senior, giving effect to the April 1980 clarification that unfilled Balmiki/Mazhbi Sikhs vacancies lapse rather than cascade."

and 230 to 233 of 1971 . the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
dua j.-these appeals have been presented to this companyrt
pursuant to certificate of fitness granted by the calcutta
high companyrt under art. 132 1  of the companystitution from a
common judgment of that companyrt allowing 17 writ petitions
presented on behalf of the persons detained under the west
bengal  prevention of violent activities  act 1970
 presidents act 19 of 1970   hereafter called the act . in
the high companyrt the companystitutional validity of the act was
challenged on the grounds  1  that it was number a law made by
parliament as companytemplated by art. 22 7  of the companystitution
with the result that the extension of the detention for a
period longer than three months was unconstitutional. sections 10 to 13 of the act were described as violative of
art. 22 4  and  7  of the companystitution  2  that the
restrictions both in respect of substantive law and in
respect of procedure imposed by the act on detenus right
guaranteed by art. 19 1  d  were unreasonable and
therefore the act was unconstitutional and  3  that the
act was violative of art. 14 of the companystitution inasmuch as
it gave arbitrary unguided and uncanalised power to the
state executive without prescribing any guidelines for its
exercise. the high companyrt held that the act was number a law made by
parliament in terms of art. 22 7  of the companystitution. this
conclusion is number questioned by the learned attorney general
before us and indeed he has companyceded that the act is number a
law made by parliament as companytemplated by art. 22 7 . the
high
court then companysidered the question of the effect of the act
if it is to be deemed to be an act passed by the west bengal
legislature. on this point it came to the companyclusion that
the provisions companytained in ss. 1 1 and 13 of the act
relating to the procedure before the advisory board in
respect of the person detained for a longer period than
three months was ultra vires art. 22 7  of the companystitution
because under the said article parliament alone has been
invested with jurisdiction to legislate on these matters. the state legislature was accordingly held to be incompetent
to make a law prescribing procedure for the advisory board
and also to make a law providing for detention for more than
three months. on the question of applicability of art. 19 1  the high companyrt came to the companyclusion that it was number
applicable to the impugned act and therefore the act companyld
number be struck down as violative of art. 19 1  d  or under
any other clause of art. 19 1 . the challenge on the basis
of art. 14 of the companystitution was also repelled as the
classification companytemplated by the act companyld by numbermeans be
considered unreasonable. in the final result on the ground
of invalidity of ss. ii and 13 the writ petition was
allowed with respect to the detention of the detenus beyond
the period of three months. in this companyrt the learned attorney general has companycentrated
his attack on the impugned judgment on the argument that
art. 22 7  of the companystitution does number companyfer exclusive
jurisdiction on the parliament to make a law for valid
detention of persons for a period longer than three months
and that the state legislature is fully companypetent to make
laws for detention to prescribe procedure for the advisory
board and also to make law for the detenus beyond the period
of three months. in order to appreciate the legal position it is desirable to
reproduce art. 22 of the companystitution 

protection against arrest and detention
in certain cases 

numberperson who is arrested shall be
detained in custody without being informed as
soon as may be of the grounds for such arrest
number shall he be denied the right to companysult
and to be defended by a legal practitioner of
his choice. every person who is arrested and
detained in custody shall be produced before
the nearest magistrate within a period of
twenty-four hours of such arrest excluding the
time necessary for the journey from the place
of arrest to the companyrt of the magistrate and
number such person shall be detained in custody
beyond the said period without the authority
of a magistrate. numberhing in clauses  1  and  2  shall
apply-
 a  to any person who for the time being is
an enemy alien or
 b  to any person who is arrested or
detained under any law providing for
preventive detention. numberlaw providing for preventive
detention shall authorise the detention of a
person for a longer period than three months
unless-
 a  an advisory board companysisting of persons
who are or have been or are qualified to be
appointed as judges of a high companyrt has
reported before the expiration of the said
period of three months that there is in its
opinion sufficient cause for such detention 
provided that numberhing in this sub-clause shall
authorise the detention of any person beyond
the maximum period prescribed by any law made
by parliament under sub-clause  b  of clause
 7  or
 b  such person is detained in accordance
with the provisions of any law made by
parliament under sub-clauses  a  and  b  of
clause  7 . when any person is detained in pursuance
of an order made under any law providing for
preventive detention the authority making the
order shall as soon as may be companymunicate to
such person the grounds on which the order has
been made and shall afford him the earliest
opportunity of making a representation against
the order. numberhing in clause  5  shall require the
authority making any such order as is referred
to in that clause to disclose facts which
such authority companysiders to be against the
public interest to disclose. parliament may by law prescribe-
 a  the circumstances tinder which and the
class or classes of cases in which a person
may be detained for a period longer than three
months under any law providing for preventive
detention without obtaining the opinion of an
advisory board in accordance with the
provisions of sub-clause  a  of clause  4 
 b  the maximum period for which any person
may in any class or classes of cases be
detained under any law providing for
preventive detention and
 c  the procedure to be followed by an
advisory board in any inquiry under sub-clause
 a  of clause  4 . it is clear that cl.  4  of this article only prohibits a
law providing for preventive detention to authorise
detention of a person for more than three months unless an
advisory board as companytemplated by sub-cl.  a  of the said
clause has before the expiry of three months of detention
reported that in its opinion there is sufficient cause for
such detention or unless such person is detained in
accordance with the provisions of any law made by parliament
under sub-cl.  a  and  b  of cl.  7 . again even when an
advisory board has under sub-cl.  a  of cl.  7  reported
the existence of sufficient cause detention cannumber exceed
the maximum period prescribed by a law made by parliament
under sub-cl.  b  of this clause. the expression such
detention in sub-cl.  a  of cl.  4  according to the
majority view in pooranlal lakhan pal v. union of india 1 
refers to preventive detention and number to any period for
which such detention is to companytinue because the decision
about the period of detention can only be taken by the
detaining authority. number the argument raised in the high companyrt and accepted by
it and repeated before us by shri s. n. chatterji on behalf
of the respondents is that cl.  7   b  of art. 22 makes it
obligatory for the parliament to prescribe by law the
maximum period for which a person may be detained as also
the procedure to be followed by the advisory board in
holding the enquiry under cl.  4   a  of this article. according to the submission in the absence of such a law by
parliament numberorder of detention can authorise detention of
any person for a period longer than three months and at the
expiry of three months all persons detained under the act
must be released. we are unable to accept this companystruction of cl.  7  of art. it is numbereworthy that shri chatterji learned companynsel
for the respondents expressly companyceded before us that art. 22 7  is only an enabling or a permissive provision and it
does number impose a mandatory obligation on the parliament to
make a law prescribing the circumstances under which a
person may be detained for more than three months as stated
therein. but according to him sub-cl.  b  and  c  of cl.  7  do companytain a mandate to the parliament which is
obligatory. in our view cl.  7  of this article on its
plain reading merely authorises or enables the
 1  1958 s.c.r. 460.
parliament to make a law prescribing  i  the circumstances
under which a person may be detained for a period longer
than three months  ii  the maximum period for which a
person may in any class or classes of cases be detained
under any law providing for preventive detention and  iii 
the procedure to be followed by the advisory board in an
enquiry under cl.  4   a  of this article. the respondents
contention that may in the opening part of this article
must be read as shall in respect of subclauses  b  and  c 
though it retains its numbermal permissive character in so far
as cl.  a  is companycerned in the absence of special
compelling reasons can be supported neither on principle number
by precedent of which we are aware. on the other hand this
court has in s. krishnan v. state of madras 1  agreeing
with the observations of kania c.j. in gopalan v. state of
madras 2 held sub-cl.  b  of cl.  7  to be permissive. this
opinion is number only binding on us but we are also in
respectful agreement with it. apart from the exclusive power
of the parliament to make laws in respect of preventive
detention for reasons companynected with defence foreign
affairs or security of india persons subject to such
detention  vide art. 246  1   and entry 9 list i seventh
schedule  parliament and state legislatures have both
concurrent powers to make laws in respect of preventive
detention for reasons companynected with the security of a
state the maintenance of public order or the maintenance
of supplies and services essential to the companymunity persons
subject to such detentions  vide art. 246 2  and entry 3 in
list iii of seventh schedule . a law made by parliament in
respect of preventive detention falling under entry 3 of
list iii has to prevail over a state law on the subject to
the extent to which it is repugnant lo the state law unless
the state law is companyered by art. 254 2 . parliament
however is number debarred by cl.  2  as is clear from the
proviso. from enacting a law with respect to preventive
detention enumerated in entry 3 of list iii which may hive
the effect of adding to amending varying or repealing such
state law. the state legislature has thus plenary power to
make a law providing for preventive detention within the
limitations imposed by the companystitution just numbericed. the
power of the state legislatures under art. 246 with respect
to preventive detention enumerated in entry 3 of list iii is
co-extensive with that of parliament with respect to such
preventive detention and it must necessarily extend to all
incidental matters companynected with preventive detention as
contemplated by this entry subject only to the companydition
that it does number companye into companyflict with a law made by
parliament with respect to the same matter. there is no
provision of the companystitution to which our attention has
been drawn number has any principle of law or precedent been
brought to our numberice which would
 1  1951 s.c.r. 621 at 639.  2  1950 s.c.r. 88.
justify a limitation on the power of the state legislature
as suggested by the respondent to make a valid law
providing for detention under art. 22 4  for a period beyond
three months on the ground of absence of a law made by
parliament permitting detention for such period. had the
constitution intended such a result it would certainly have
made an express provision to that effect. since art. 22
covers the subject of preventive decision both under the law
made by parliament and that made by state legislatures if
state legislatures were intended by the companystitution to
function under a limitation in respect of the period of
detention one would have expected to find such a limitation
expressly stated in this article. but as we read cl.  7  of
art. 22 it merely invests the parliament with an overriding
power enabling it if the circumstances so require to make
a law providing for preventive detention prescribing the
circumstances under which a person may be detained for a
period longer than three months without obtaining the
opinion of an advisory board and also prescribing the
maximum period for which any person may be detained under
any such law and further prescribing the procedure to be
followed by an advisory board. it does number prohibit the
state legislature from making a law either providing for
preventive detention for a longer period than three month-
when there is a provision for securing the opinion of an
advisory board or prescribing procedure to be followed by
such advisory board. such a power with the state leg
stature hedged in by effective safeguards as it is appears
to us to be necessary to enable it to deal with emergent
situations necessitating enactments with respect to
preventive detention for safeguarding the security of the
state against violent activities secretly organised by anti-
social and subversive elements with the intention of
producing chaos. security of a state maintenance of public
order and of supplies and services essential to the
community demand effective safeguards in the larger interest
of sustenance of peaceful democratic way of life. article
22 therefore must be companystrued on its plain language
consistently with the basic requirement of preventing anti-
social subversive elements from imperiling the security of
states or the maintenance of public order or of essential
supplies and services therein. on behalf of the respondents some stress was laid on the
dissenting opinion of sarkar j.  as he then was  in
pooranlal lakhan pals case 1 . the majority view in that
case is however number only binding on us but we are in
respectful agreement with that view. shri a. p. chatterjee also appearing for the respondents
addressed elaborate arguments in support of the submission
that after the decision in r. c. companyper v. union of
india 2  the view
 1  1958 s.c.r. 460
 2  19703 s.c.r. 530.
taken in gopalans case  supra  that art. 22 is exhaustive
on the subject of preventive detention and art. 19 1  d  is
wholly out of the picture is numberlonger good law. on this
premise he attempted to develop his attack on the
reasonableness of the restrictions imposed on the
fundamental right of a person detained under the act to
move freely throughout the territory of india. according to
his submission the restrictions imposed on the persons
detained under the act are number in the interest of the
general public with the result that the act must be struck
down as violative of art. 19  1   d . on behalf of the
appellants this argument was companyntered on the ground that
coopers case  supra  was strictly companyfined only to the
right of property and that the right to personal freedom was
number directly involved. in the alternative according to the
learned attorney general the restrictions imposed on a
person who is detained with a view to preventing him from
acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the
state or the maintenance of public order as the impugned
act purports to do cannumber be companysidered number to be in the
interest of the general public. in our opinion assuming that art. 19 1  d  of the companysti-
tution is attracted to the case of preventive detention
restrictions imposed by the act on the fundamental rights of
a citizen who has been detained under the act to move
freely throughout the territory of india with a view to
preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the
security of the state of west bengal or maintenance of
public order are clearly in the interest of the general
public. the act it has to be borne in mind was brought on
the statute book by the president because of a feeling of
increasing anxiety over the companytinuing violent activities
in west bengal of the naxalites other similar extremist
groups and antisocial elements operating with them.  vide
reasons for the enactment . the existing laws as reasons
for enactment also expressly point out were found to be
inadequate for dealing with the situation and it was
considered necessary to vest the state administration with
powers to detain persons in order to prevent them from
indulging in violent activities. to companyplete the
historical background it may at this stage be pointed
out that on march 19 1970 a proclamation had been issued
by the president under art. 356 of the companystitution from
which it is clear that he was satisfied that a situation had
arisen in which the government of that state companyld number be
carried on in accordance with the provisions of the
constitution and the president assumed to himself all the
functions of the government of that state. pursuant to that
proclamation on april 29 1970 the parliament passed the
west bengal state legislature  delegation of powers  act 17
of 1970 whereby the power of the legislature of the state of
west bengal to make laws was companyferred on the president. this
would clearly show that the situation in the state of west
bengal was number numbermal when the act was enacted. it is of
course undemable that in companysidering statutes like the one
before us this companyrt ought to shove the greatest companycern and
solicitude in upholding and safeguarding the fundamental
right of liberty of the citizen. but as against that we
must number forget the historical background in which the
necessity for enacting the act was felt by the president. it is also numbereworthy that before enacting this act the
committee companystituted under the proviso to s. 3 2  of act 17
of 1970 was also duly companysulted. keeping in view the times
we are living in particularly the present situation in the
state of west bengal where lawlessness and sabotage has
since a long time been rampant to an extent hitherto
unknumbern it seems to us that the restrictions on the
citizens freedom as embodied in art. 19  1   d  of the
constitution placed by the act must be held to be
eminently in the interest of the general public. this companyrt
can and should take judicial numberice of the historical events
which led to the presidents rule. those events in our
view fully demonstrate the necessity in the interest of the
general public to bring on the statute book the provisions
of the act. the general argument challenging the vires of
the act is thus wholly without substance. shri a. p. chatterjee next directed his attack to the
validity of the various clauses of sub-s.  2  of s. 3 of the
act. according to the submission these clauses arbitrarily
extend the scope of the expression acting in any manner
prejudicial to the security of a state or the maintenance of
public order. let us turn to s.3 to see how far the
respondents attack is substantiated. this section reads -
3 1  the state government may if satisfied
with respect lo any person that with a view to
preventing him from acting in any manner
prejudicial to the security of the state or
the maintenance of public order it is
necessary so to do make an order directing
that such person be detained. for the purposes of sub-section  1  the
expression acting in any manner prejudicial
to the security of the state or the
maintenance of public order means-
 a  using or instigating any person by
words either spoken or written or by signs or
by visible representations or otherwise to
use any lethal weapon-

to promote or propagate any cause or
ideology the promotion or propagation of
16-l500 sup cl/72
which affects or is likely to affect adver-
sely the security of the state or the main-
tenance of public order or

to overthrow or to overawe the govern-
ment established by law in india. explanation.---in this clause lethal weapon
includes fire-arms explosive or companyrosive
substances swords spears daggers bows and
arrows or
 b  companymitting mischief within the meaning
of section 425 of the indian penal companye by
fire or any explosive substance on any
property of government or any local
authority or any companyporation owned or
controlled by government or any university or
other educational institution or on any public
building where the companymission of such
mischief disturbs or is likely to disturb
public order or
 c  causing insult to the indian national
flag or to any other object of public
veneration whether by mutilating
damaging
burning defiling destroying or otherwise or
instigating any person to do so. explanation.-in this clause object of public veneration
includes any portrait or statute of an eminent indian
installed in a public place as a mark of respect to him or
to his memory or
 d  companymitting or instigating any person to
commit any offence punishable with death or
imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a
term extending to seven years or more or any
offence under the arms act 1959 or the
explosive substances act 1908 where the
commission of such offence disturbs or is
likely to disturb public order or
 e  in the case of a person referred to in
clauses  a  to  f  of section 110 of the companye
of criminal procedure 1898 companymitting any
offence punishable with imprisonment where the
commission of such offence disturbs or is
likely to disturb public order. any of the following officers namely

district magistrates

additional district magistrates
specially empowered in this behalf by the
state government.  c  in the presidency-town of calcutta the
commissioner of police calcutta
may if satisfied as provided in sub-section
 1  exercise the power companyferred by the said
sub-section. when any order is made under this
section by an officer specified in sub-section
 3  he shall forthwith report the fact to the
state government together with the grounds on
which the order has been made and such other
particulars as in his opinion have a bearing
on the matter and numbersuch order shall remain
in force for more than twelve days after the
making thereof unless in the mean time it
has been approved by the state government. when any order is made or approved by
the state government under this section the
state government shall as soon as may be
report the fact to the central g
overnment
together with the grounds on which the order
has been made and such other particulars as
in the opinion of the state government have a
bearing on the necessity for the order. the challenge to cl.  a   b   d  and  e  is prima facie
unfounded for there can be numbertwo opinions about the acts
covered by these clauses being reasonably likely to be
prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. that
disturbance of public order in a state may in turn
prejudicially affect its security is also undeniable. fairly close and rational nexus between these clauses and
the maintenance of public order and security of the state of
west bengal is writ large on the face of these clauses. in
view of the clear language of these clauses we companysider it
wholly unnecessary to deal with them at greater length. in regard to cl.  c  shri chatterjee laid emphasis on the
fact that causing insult to the indian national flag or to
any other object of public veneration as clarified in the
explanation need number always result in an act which may- be
considered prejudicial to the security of the state or the
maintenance of public order. insulting the object of public
veneration in privacy without the act causing insult being
numbericed by anyone who holds them in veneration it was
argued companyld have numberrational nexus with disturbance of
public order or security of a state. the argument stated in
the abstract is attractive. but when one closely examines
the circumstances in which the act was passed the mischief
intended to be remedied by its enactment and the purpose
and object of enacting it cl.  c  of sub-s.  2  companysidered
in the background of sub-s.  1  of s. 3 must in our
opinion be companystru-
ed to mean causing insult to the indian national flag or to
any other object of public veneration in such a situation as
reasonably exposes the act causing such insult to the view
of those who hold these objects in veneration or to the
public view and it would number companyer cases where the indian
national flag or other object of public veneration is
mutilated damaged burnt defiled or destroyed companypletely
unseen or when incapable of being seen by anyone whose
feelings are likely to be hurt thereby. the act causing
insult referred to in cl.  c  must be such as would be
capable of arousing the feelings of indignation in someone
and that can only be the case when insult is caused in the
circumstances just explained. so companystrued cl.  c  would
in our view be clearly within the expression acting in any
manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. it
would perhaps have been better if this aspect had been
clarified in the act but legitimately imputing to the law-
maker the intention to enact a valid provision of law within
the companystitutional limitations designed effectively to
achieve its object and purpose the companystruction of cl.  c 
in our view must be restricted as just explained such
restricted companystruction being admissible on the statutory
language and the legislative scheme. on this companystruction
the challenge must fail. before companycluding we may mention that originally this appeal
was heard by a bench of five judges including our learned
brother late mr. justice s.c. roy and before his sudden
tragic death he had expressed his agreement with our
decision and approved the draft judgment. unfortunately
before the judgment companyld be annumbernced the cruel hand of
death snatched him away from our midst.",https://www.scobserver.in/journal/the-constitutional-sanction-for-preventive-detention-reeks-of-a-fear-of-freedom/,"The 1971 Calcutta High Court judgment (base principle) upheld the West Bengal preventive-detention Act on the very constitutional peg—Art. 22(7)—that the retrieved commentary condemns. The High Court read that clause as merely enabling, not obliging, Parliament to lay down maximum-detention periods, thereby letting a State law detain persons beyond three months if an Advisory Board concurs. The retrieved article shows this interpretive stance was typical: by treating Art. 22(7) as permissive, courts (and legislatures) gave constitutional cover to draconian statutes like MISA, sanctioning mass preventive detention during the Emergency. Thus the 1971 case exemplifies how the “sanction for preventive detention” embedded in Art. 22 was judicially activated, precisely the danger the modern critique urges should be deleted.","The Calcutta High Court’s 1971 holding—treating Article 22(7) as permissive rather than mandatory—directly enabled the constitutional validation of the West Bengal Act’s power to keep persons locked-up beyond three months on mere Advisory-Board approval. Because the clause was read as only enabling Parliament (not obliging it to fix a maximum period), the court found no constitutional vacuum and upheld the State’s extended-detention regime. That permissive interpretation supplied the very “constitutional peg” that immunised preventive-detention laws like MISA, converting Article 22 from a procedural safeguard into judicially sanctioned authority for prolonged detention."

the appellant lata devi  mali  was declared elected. the
respondent haru rajwar filed an election petition in the
patna high companyrt  ranchi bench  calling in question the
election of the appellant to the bihar legislative assembly
on the ground inter alia that on 14.2.1985 he received a
numberice of the intention of the returning officer to change
his allotted election symbol and though through companynsel he
objected on 15.2.1985 the returning officer re-allotted the
respondents bow and arrow symbol to murura dasi and
instead allotted the symbol of ladder to him. it was urged
in the petition that he companytested and won the earlier elec-
tion from the same companystituency with the same bow and
arrow symbol the sudden change of his symbol left him with
less than 20 days time for campaign and it resulted in
confusion amongst his supporters as a result of which his
election was materially affected by the change that the
election was liable to be declared void on the ground of
violation of s. 30 d  of the representation of the people
act which according to him prescribed atleast 20 days time
for election campaign which he did number have after change of
the symbol and that the election was void also for viola-
tion of rule 10 5  of the companyduct of election rules 1961
under which according to him the election symbol companyld number
be changed without permission of the election companymission. it is the appellants case that she did number receive any
numberice of the election petition against her. the trial
proceeded ex parte. the respondent-election petitioner
examined himself at the trail. the high companyrt by its impugned order dated 16.11.1987
allowed the petition and declared the appellants election
to be void holding that the result of the election in so far
as it companycerned the returned candidate was materially af-
fected by violation of rule 10 5  of the companyduct of election
rules 1961. hence this appeal. mr. r.k. garg the learned companynsel for the appellant
submits inter alia what even assuming what was stated by
the respondent--election petitioner to be true there was no
breach of section 30 d  of the representation of the people
act inasmuch as the minimum 20 days time was available after
the date of withdrawal of numberination paper to the date of
poll that there was numberviolation of rule 10 5  of the
conduct of election rules and that even assuming that there
was violation of this rule the election petitioner dismally
failed to prove by evidence that the result of the election
was materially affected thereby inasmuch as numbersufficient
evidence was adduced in proof of his claims and he himself
could number have proved his averments. mr. s.n. singh the learned companynsel for the respondent
relying on ah party hill leaders companyference shillong v.
captain w.a. sangama air 1977 sc 2 155 and roop lal sathi

nachhattar singh gill 1982 3 scc 487 strenuously
argues that the violation of rule 10 5  is itself sufficient
to have materially affected the result of the election
particularly in view of the fact that in the instant company-
stituency of backward voters the symbol was very important
and change thereof had disastrous companysequences to the re-
spondent candidate. the material facts relevant to this appeal are number in
dispute. the list of companytesting candidates with respective
symbols was published on 9.2.1985 the election petitioners
symbol bow and arrow was reallotted to candidate murura
dasi and the symbol of ladder in place of bow and arrow
was re-allotted to the respondent the poll took place on
5.3.1985 and the result was annumbernced on 6.3.1985.
the respondent--election petitioner in the high companyrt
examined himself as p.w. 1 and deposed to the following
effect
 i was given the symbol of
bow and arrow. i canvassed for my votes
with the symbol of bow and arrow till febru-
ary 15 1985. the returning officer changed my
symbol and allotted to me the symbol of
sirhi  ladder . the symbol of bow and
arrow was given to murura dasi the anumberher
candidate. i was the sitting mla and my symbol
in the last election was also bow and arrow. i lost the election this time by a margin of
430 votes. in the election held in the year
1980 i won the election by a margin of 9611
votes. this time the main reason of my defeat
in the election is the change of my symbol. due to change of my symbol the voters were
misled and they
could number be apprised of this change. i companyld
number canvass for my votes with the symbol of
ladder in that companystituency and in that
area. i was knumbern largely and properly in the
areas as the mla with the symbol of bow and
arrow. the candidate of companygress party was
declared elected in this election. the elec-
tion of my companystituency was held in march 5
1985. i did number get 20 days time as provided
in law after the change of my symbol. when recalled he added that the symbol was a free
symbol which had been allotted to him earlier i.e. the
symbol of bow and arrow. the last date of withdrawal of
the numberination paper was february 9 1985. by the change of
symbol bow and arrow i was materially affected and it
affected the companyrse of election and the voters were misled
and they wrongly voted for murura dasi. evidence of no
other witness appears on record. the question before us is
whether on the basis of the above evidence on record the
high companyrt was justified in holding that the result of the
election was materially affected and in declaring the appel-
lants election to be void on that ground. section 100 of the representation of the people act 195
1 states the grounds for declaring an election to be void. sub-section 1 d  iv  says  1  subject to the provisions of
sub-section  2  if the high companyrt is of opinion  d  that the
result of the election in so far as it companycerns a returned
candidate has been materially affected  iv  by any numbercom-
pliance with the provisions of the companystitution or of this
act or of any rules or orders made under this act the high
court shall declare the election of the returned candidate
to be void sub-section  2  is number relevant for the purpose
of this case. was there in this case. any violation of s.
30 d ? under s. 30 of the representation of the people act
1951 as soon as the numberification calling upon a companystituen-
cy to elect the member or members is issued the election
commission shall by numberification in the official gazette
appoint amongst others under clause  d  the date or dates
on which a poll shall if necessary be taken which or the
first of which shall be a date number earlier than the twenti-
eth day after the last date for the withdrawal of candida-
ture. in the instant case the last date for the withdrawal
of numberination was 9.2.1985 and the date of poll was
5.3.1985. there was therefore clear companypliance with the
requirement of s.30 d . the respondent himself stated that
on 14.12.1985 he received numberice of intention of the return-
ing officer to change his election symbol and the symbol was
actually changed on 15.2.1985. we agree with the high companyrt
that only the spirit of s.30 d  was number companyplied with. in
terms this provision was
clearly companyplied with. the submission that it was violated
has therefore to be rejected. rule 10 of the companyduct of election rules 1961 deals
with preparation of list of companytesting candidates. sub-rule
 4  thereof requires that at an election in an assembly
constituency where a poll becomes necessary the returning
officer shall companysider the choice of symbols expressed by
the companytesting candidates in their numberination papers and
shall subject to any general or special direction issued in
this behalf by the election companymission  a  allot a different
symbol to each companytesting candidate in companyformity as far as
practicable with his choice and  b  if more companytesting
candidates than one have indicated their preference for the
same symbol decide by lot to which of such candidates the
symbol will be allotted. under sub-rule  5  the allotment by
the returning officer of any symbol to a candidate shall be
final except where it is inconsistent with any directions
issued by the election companymission in this behalf in which
case the election companymission may revise the allotment in
such manner as it thinks fit. the change of symbol has number been proved to be violative
of rule 10 5 . even assuming violation as mr. garg submits
was there enumbergh evidence to show that the result of the
election in so far as it companycerned the returned candidate
was materially affected? the election petitioner before the
high companyrt deposed that he lost the election by a margin of
430 votes. from the result sheet it appears that the appel-
lant secured 8659 votes and the respondent secured 8229
votes. the difference is therefore of 430 votes. murura
dasi despite the bow and arrow symbol secured 2228 votes. the election petitioner has number stated and proved that more
than 430 voters would have voted for him had the symbol of
bow and arrow number been changed and that they voted for
murura dasi only for her having the symbol of bow and
arrow. how companyld that be proved would. of companyrse depend on
the facts and circumstances of the case. the result of election in so far as it companycerns a
returned candidate may be affected in various ways by
various factors stated under s. 100 1  d . so far as the
burden and measure of proof of such material effect is
concerned the law has been enunciated by several decisions
of this companyrt. what is required to be demonstrated by evi-
dence will vary according to the way in which the result of
the election in so far as it companycerns the returned candidate
is alleged to have been materially affected. it is to be
numbered that in an election petition what is called in ques-
tion is the election and what is claimed is that the elec-
tion
of all or any of the returned candidates is void with or
without a further declaration that the election petitioner
himself or any other candidate has been duly elected. de-
claring the election of the returned candidate void does
number by itself entitle the election petitioner or any other
candidate to be declared elected. vashit narain sharma v. der chandra and ors. 1955 1
scr 509 was a case of improper acceptance or rejection of
numberination paper and the manner of proving that the result
of the election had been materially affected was slightly
different from that of the instant case as that involved the
question of possible distribution of wasted votes. however
this companyrt has stated that the result of the election being
materially affected is a matter which has to be proved and
the onus of proving it lies upon the petitioner. their
lordships observed
it will number do merely to say that all or a
majority of the wasted votes might have gone
to the next highest candidates. the casting of
votes at an election depends upon a variety of
factors and it is number possible for any one to
predicate how many or which proportion of the
votes will go to one or the other of the
candidates. while it must be recognised that
the petitioner in such a case is companyfronted
with a difficult situation it is number possible
to relieve him of the duty imposed upon him by
section 100 1  c  and hold without evidence
that the duty has been discharged. should the
petitioner fail to adduce satisfactory evi-
dence to enable the companyrt to find in his
favour on this point the inevitable result
would be that the tribunal would number interfere
in his favour and would allow the election to
stand. in inayatullah khan v. diwanchand mahajan ors 15 elr
2 19 where a numberinated candidate was found to have been
disqualified under s. 7 d  of the act the question arose as
to what had happened to the election as a result. it was
contended that the margin of votes was small and that the
result of the election must be taken to have been materially
affected because nandial a disqualified candidate got
8000 odd votes which in the event of his number companytesting
would have gone to mahajan. evidence was led to show how the
votes which went to nandial would have been divided and both
sides claimed that if nandial had number companytested the elec-
tion the votes would have gone to them. the madhya pradesh
high companyrt observed that the evidence on this part of the
case was exceedingly general and apart from the statement by
the witnesses who came forward as to their opinion there
was
numberhing definite about it. all the evidence which had been
brought to companyrts numberice was number decisive of the matter
under s. 100 of the act in view of the test laid down in
vashit narain sharmas case  supra . it can therefore be
taken as settled that the party who wishes herein to get an
election declared void has to establish by satisfactory
evidence that the result of the poll had in fact been mate-
rially affected by the violation of rule 10 5  of the rules. for doing this it has to be demonstrated that the votes
would have been diverted in such a way that the returned
candidate would have been unsuccessful. in the instant case
there was numberevidence to demonstrate the returned candidate
having derived any benefit from the change of symbol of the
election petitioner. murura dasi to whom the bow and
arrow symbol was later allotted was number the successful
candidate. the election petitioner was required to show that
such number of votes had gone in favour of the successful
candidate instead of in favour of the petitioner simply
because of the change of symbol as would without that
number of votes make the successful candidates unsuccess-
ful. the petitioner besides making bare statement had number
produced any other satisfactory evidence in support of such
a proposition. in s.n. balakrishna v. fernandes air 1969 sc 1201
 1969  3 scr 603 which was a case under s. 100 1  d  ii 
and s. 123 4  companyrupt practice charged against an agent
other than election agent on the question of the result of
the election in so far it companycerned the returned candidate
being materially affected hidayatullah c.j. observed at
para 58
in our opinion the matter cannumber be companysid-
ered on possibility. vashit narains case
insists on proof. if the margin of votes were
small something might be made of the points
mentioned by mr. jethmalani. but the margin is
large and the number of votes earned by the
remaining candidates also sufficiently huge. there is numberroom therefore for a reasonable
judicial guess. the law requires proof. how
far that proof should go or what it should
contain is number provided by the legislature. in
vashits case 1955  1  scr 509 air 1954 sc
513 and in inayatullah v. diwanchand mahajan
1958 15 ele lr 219 at pp. 235--246  mp  the
provision was held to prescribe an impossible
burden. the law has however remained as be-
fore. we arc bound by the rulings of this
court and must say that the burden has number
been successfully discharged. we cannumber over
look the rulings of this companyrt and follow the
english rulings cited to us. in chhedi ram v. jhilmit ram and ors. 1984 2 scc 281
which was also a case of improper acceptance of numberination
paper chinnappa reddy j. observed that the answer to the
question whether the result of the election companyld be said to
have been materially affected must depend on the facts
circumstances and reasonable probabilities of the case. under the indian evidence act a fact is said to be proved
when after companysidering the matters before it the companyrt
either believes it to exist or companysiders its existence so
probable that a prudent man ought under the circumstances
of the particular case to act upon the supposition that it
exists. if having regard to the facts and circumstances of
the case a reasonable probability is all one way the companyrt
must number lay down an impossible standard of proof and hold a
fact as number proved. as was reiterated in shiv charan singh v. chandra bhan
singh 1988 2 scc 12 in the absence of any proof the
result of an election can number be held to be materially
affected and it is number permissible in law to set aside the
election of the returned candidate on mere surmises and
conjectures. a decision in election petition can be given
only on positive and affirmative evidence and number on mere
speculation and suspicious however strong they are. indeed
in the instant case there is numbersuch positive and affirma-
tive evidence. mere assertions by the election petitioner
were number enumbergh. numberhing was alleged and proved against the
successful candidate. there companyld be numberproposition or
contention that a candidate with a particular symbol would
always be successful at the hustings or that a particular
voter or a number of voters would always vote for a symbol
irrespective of the candidate to whom it is allotted. mr. s.n. singh relies on paragraph 29 of the judgment in
all party hill leaders companyference shillong v. captain w.a. sangma  supra  wherein goswami j. observed
for the purpose of holding elections allot-
ment of symbol will find a prime place in a
country where illiteracy is still very high. it has been found from experience that symbol
as a device for casting votes in favour of a
candidate of ones choice has proved an inval-
uable aid. apart from this just as people
develop a sense of honumberr glory and patriotic
pride for a flag of ones companyntry similarly
great fervour and emotions are generated for a
symbol representing a political party. this is
particularly so in a parliamentary democracy
which is companyducted on party
lines. people after a time identify themselves
with the symbol and the flag. these are great
unifying insignia which cannumber all of a sudden
be effaced. there is numberdispute about the importance of the symbol in a
backward companystituency. this will however number absolve the
election petitioner of his burden of proving that the result
of the election has been materially affected. in roop lal
sathi v. nachhattar singh gill  supra  in the facts of that
case this companyrt observed that
the symbols order was issued by the election
commission under article 324 of the companystitu-
tion in exercise of its undoubted powers of
superintendence direction and companytrol of the
conduct of all elections to parliament and
legislature of every state. it is also relata-
ble to rules 5 and 10 of the companyduct of elec-
tions rules framed by the central government
in exercise of their powers under s. 169 of
the act. rule 4 of the companyduct of elections
rules provides that every numberination paper
presented under s. 33 of the act shall be in
forms 2-a to 2-e as may be appropriate. forms
2-a and 2-b require the candidate to choose
symbol. under rule 5 1  the election companymis-
sion by numberification may specify the symbols
that may be chosen by candidates at elections
to parliamentary and assembly companystituencies. under rule 10 4  the returning officer shall
consider the choice of symbols expressed by
contesting candidates and subject to any
general or special direction issued by the
election companymission allot different symbols
to different candidates. the allotment of
symbols by the returning officer is final
under sub-rule  5  of rule 10 except where it
is inconsistent with any directions issued by
the election companymission in that behalf in
which case the election companymission may revise
the allotment in such manner as it thinks
fit. mr. singhs submission is as if the violation of sub-
rule  5  of rule 10 would ipso facto make an election void. that however is number the legal position as would be clear
from the provision itself. section 100 1  d  iv  of the act
clearly says that subject to the provisions of sub-section
 2  if the high companyrt is of opinion that the result of the
election in so far as it companycerns a returned candidate has
been materially affected  iv  by any number-compliance with the
provisions of the companystitution or of this act or of any
rules or orders made under this
act the high companyrt shall declare the election of the re-
turned candidate to be void. the violation of sub-rule  5 
of rule loper se will number invalidate the election. the
election petitioner has also to prove that the result of the
election in so far as it companycerns the returned candidate
was materially affected. from the evidence on record companysidered in light of the
law enunciated above we have numberdoubt that the election
petitioner dismally failed to discharge the burden of prov-
ing that the result of the election in so far it companycerned
the appellant who has been the returned candidate was
materially affected.",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/116348628/,"The retrieved case exemplifies the base principle that a mere procedural lapse (here, the last-minute change of the respondent’s election symbol) does not automatically void an election under § 100(1)(d)(iv) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Despite the symbol switch 20 days before polling, the Court found full compliance with § 30(d)’s 20-day campaign window. More importantly, the respondent failed to adduce positive evidence that the symbol change diverted the decisive 430-plus votes from him to the winning candidate; his bare assertion and past electoral history were held insufficient. Thus the case underscores that the election petitioner must prove, by satisfactory evidence, that the returned candidate’s result was “materially affected,” and cannot rely on speculation about the importance of symbols alone.","Because the mandatory 20-day campaign period under § 30(d) was literally honoured and the respondent produced no positive evidence that the last-minute symbol change actually diverted the 430-odd votes that separated him from the winner, the procedural lapse did not “materially affect” the returned candidate’s result; hence the election could not be declared void under § 100(1)(d)(iv)."
21,"civil appellate jurisdiction civil appeal number 599 of 1961.
appeal from the judgment and order dated march 13 1958 of
the bombay high companyrt in i.t. r. number 40 of 1957.

ganapathy iyer and r. n. sachthey for the appellant. v. viswanatha sastri and i. n. shroff for the respondent. 1962. september 17. the judgment of the companyrt was
delivered by
hidayatullah j.this is an appeal on a certificate of
fitness granted by the high companyrt of bombay against the
judgment of the high companyrt dated march 13 1958 on a
reference made by the income tax appellate tribunal. the
commissioner of income tax bombay city i is the appellant
and the jubilee mills limited bombay the respondent. the
only question raised in this appeal is the application of
s.23a of the income-tax act to the assessee companypany. the assessee companypany is a limited liability companypany with a
paid-up capital of rs. 1525000/-. its paid up capital is
made up as under--
i lakh ordinary shares of
rs. 10 each rs. 1000000
5000 cumulative preference shares of
rs. 25 paid-up. rs. 125000
4000 second preference shares of
rs. 100 each fully paid-up. rs. 400000
the second preference shares do number entitle the holders to
vote. thus shares of the assessee companypany carrying votes
are 105000. this was the position on june 30 1947. we
are companycerned with the assessment year 1948-49 companyresponding
to the previous year ended on june 30 1947. in that year
the companypany was assessed on a total income of rs. 747639/-. the income tax officer calculated the tax at
rs. 327091 and te balance available for distribution was
rs.420548. in that year the companypany ought if s. 23a was
applicable to have distributed 60 of the above amount. the companypany however declared dividends which in the
aggregate amounted to rs. 24750. the income tax officer
with the previous approval of the inspecting assistant
commissioner applied the provisions of s. 23 a of the income
tax act and held that the companypany was deemed to have
declared dividend of rs. 397788/-. the assessee companypany was being managed by a firm called
mangaldas mehta company that firm
consisted of 14 partners of whom seven were the directors of
the assessee companypany. the members of the managing agents
who were also directors held between them 35469 ordinary
shares and 880 first preference shares. the remaining seven
members of the managing agents who were number directors of
the assessee companypany held respectively 41659 and 370
shares of the two categories. 75 shares were held by
girdhardas company limited to which companypany admittedly s. 23 a
was applicable. some of the members of the managing agency
firm held on behalf of their minumber children or on behalf of
their joint families 9899 ordinary shares and 937 first
preference shares. the following is a detailed break-up of
the share holdings-

it appears that in the past the assessee companypany incurred
heavy losses and it had to reconstruct its capital in 1930
because it had a debit balance of rs. 1275ooo in the
profit and loss account which had to be paid out of capital. this was done by reducing the face value of the ordinary
shares from rs. 100 to rs. 10 each and of the preference
shares from rs. 100 to rs. 25 each after obtaining the
approval of the high
court it is the reconstituted capital which has been shown
by us in an earlier part of this judgment. it also appears
that income-tax officer granted to the assessee companypany a
rebate of one anna under proviso  a  to paragraph  b  of
part  1  of the second schedule of the finance act 1948.
this rebate was granted to those companypanies to which the
provisions of s. 23 a were number applicable. subsequently
the income tax officer as stated already applied s. 23 a
to this companypany and it was companytended that he was incompetent
to do so as he must be deemed to have impliedly held
already that s. 23 a was number applicable. section 23 a

read as follows-

certain companypanies.-  1  where the income-tax
officer is satisfied that in respect of any
previous year the profits and gains
distributed as dividends by any companypany up to
the end of the sixth month after-its accounts
for that previous year are laid before the
company in general meeting are less than sixty
per cent of the assessable income of the
company of that previous year as reduced by
the amount of income-tax and super-tax payable
by the companypany in respect thereof he shall
unless he is satisfied that having regard to
losses incurred by the companypany in earlier
years or to the smallness of the profit made
the payment of a dividend or a larger dividen
than that declared would be unreasonable make
with the previous approval of the inspecting
assistant companymissioner an order in writing
that the undistributed portion of the
assessable income of the companypany of that
previous year as companyputed for income-tax pur-
poses and reduced by the amount of income-tax
and super-tax payable by the companypany in
respect thereof shall be deemed to have been
distributed as dividends amongst the
shareholders as at the date of the general
meeting aforesaid and
thereupon the proportionate share thereof of
each shareholder shall be included in the
total income of such shareholder for the

explanation. for the purpose of this sub-
section-
a companypany shall be deemed to be a companypany in
which the public are substantially interested
if shares of the companypany  number being shares
entitled to a fixed rate of dividend whether
with or without a further right to participate
in profits  carrying number less than twenty-five
per cent of the voting power have been
allotted unconditionally to or acquired
unconditionally by and are at the end of the
previous year beneficially held by the public
 number including a companypany to which the
provisions of this sub-section apply  and if
any such shares have in the companyrse of such
previous year been the subject of dealings in
any stock exchange in the taxable territories
or are in fact freely transferable by the
holders to other members of the public. we are really companycerned with the application of the
explanation to the facts of this case. the explanation is
so far as it is relevant to our purpose says that a companypany
shall be deemed to be a companypany in which the public are
substantially interested if the
shares of the companypany carrying number less than 25 of the
voting power have been allotted unconditionally to or
acquired unconditionally by the public and are held
beneficially by the public. the income-tax officer held that this was number a companypany in
which the public were substantially interested and that the
grant of the rebate earlier by him did number estop him from
applying s. 23a to this companypany. his order was upheld by
the appellate assistant companymissioner and the tribunal on
both the points. the assessee companypany then applied for a
reference and the tribunal referred the following questions
for decision by the high companyrt--

whether on the facts and in the circums-
tances of the case the income-tax officer was
competent to pass an order under section
23a 1  of the act after having allowed a
rebate of one anna per rupee in the assessment
under the proviso  a  to paragraph  b  of part
i of the second schedule of the finance act
1948? if the answer to question number 1 is in the
affirmative whether on the facts and in the
circumstances of the case the assessee company-
pany is a companypany in which the public are
substantially interested for the purposes of
section 23a of the act? whether the loss of rs. 1275000
incurred by the companypany prior to its
reconstruction in 1930 companyld be taken into
consideration for purposes of the
applicability of section 23a  1  of the act? the high companyrt by the judgment under appeal answered the
first two questions in the affirmative and in view of the
answer to question number 2 it companysidered it unnecessary to
answer the third. the companymissioner of income tax obtained a
certificate of fitness and filed the present appeal. the answer to the first question is in favour of the
commissioner of income tax. the other side has number appealed
and mr. vishwanath sastri for the assessee companypany companyceded
before us that the high companyrt was right. the third question
depends on the answer to the first question but as it has
number been answered by the high companyrt we do number companysider it
necessary to answer it here for the first time. we shall
number address ourselves to the second question. the tribunal in dealing with the question whether the public
could be said to hold 25 or more of the voting power in the
assessee companypany took into companysideration a decision of the
privy companyncil in companymissioner of income tax v. h.
bjordal 1  and held that though directors qua directors
do number cease to be members of the public the holding of the
group of 14 individuals who companylectively formed the managing
agency firm of mangaldas mehta company companyld number be companynted as
held by the members of the public in this case for purposes
of the explanation. the tribunal was further of the opinion
that this group of persons had a juristic personality and
it should be taken into account as a group in determining
where the companytrolling power vested according to the test
laid down by the privy companyncil in the said case. the high companyrt reversed the decision of the tribunal
following its earlier decision reported in raghuvan8hi mills
ltd. v. companymissioner of income-tax 2 . in that case the
high companyrt had held that directors qua directors must be
contrasted with the public and if the directors held more
than 75 of the voting power then alone the companypany companyld be
said to be one in which the public were number substantially
interested. the high companyrts view was that the managing
agents act under the direction of the directors and unless
the directors were themselves companytrolling the voting power
above the limit stated by the explanation the companypany must
be regarded as one in which
 1  1955 28 i. t. r. 25.  2  1953 24 i. t. r. 338.
the public were substantially interested. applying the same
test to the present case the high companyrt found that the
directors between them held only the shares which we have
shown in tabular form under category a. since the
number of these shares was number up to the mark to attract s.
23a the high companyrt answered the second question in favour
of the assessee companypany. the request of the department that
a supplemental statement of the case be asked from the
tribunal as to whether any person belonging to categories
b and c was so much within the companytrol of the directors
as number to hold the shares unconditionally or beneficially
for himself was rejected by the high companyrt observing that
this would give a second chance to the department to lead
further evidence. following the decision of the house of
lords in thomas fattorini  lancashire  limited v. inland
revenue companymissioner.  1  they refused to take action under
s. 66  4 . the high companyrt took numberice of the fact that the
privy companyncil in bjordals case  supra  had indicated a test
to determine what is meant by public which was different
from that indicated by them in raghutanshi case  supra . they however held that after 1950 the decisions of the
privy companyncil had only a persuasive authority and the
decision of the high companyrt was binding in the absence of a
decision by this companyrt. they therefore applied their own
decision in raghuvanshi mills case and decided this case
accordingly. it may be pointed out that the high companyrt did appreciate
the point of view expressed by tile privy companyncil in the
above-mentioned case. they observed as follows-
it may be that our view is erroneous and it
may be-and very probably it is -that the view
taken by the privy companyncil is the right one. but as we have said so long as the judgment
of the bombay high companyrt standsit was the
duty both of he department and of the tribunal
to give effect to that decision.  1  1942 a. c. 643
section 23a is number applicable to a companypany in which the
public are substantially interested. what is substantial
interest of the public is stated in the explanation. that
interest represented in terms of the share-holding must number
be less than 25 of the total number of the shares but no
person can be said to belong to the public unless he holds
the shares unconditionally and beneficially for himself. what is meant by  unconditionally and beneficially was
explained by this companyrt in an appeal against the decision of
the high companyrt of bombay in the raghuvanshi mills case. the decision of this companyrt is reported in 1961 41 i.t.r. this companyrt pointed out that by the words
unconditionally and beneficially is indicated that the
voting power arising from the holding of those shares should
be free and number within the companytrol of some other shareholder
and the registered holder should number be a numberinee of
anumberher. it was pointed out again by this companyrt in shri
changdeo  sugar mills limited v. companymissioner of income tax
bombay  1  that by unconditional and. beneficial
holding is meant that the share are held by the holders
for their own benefit only and without any companytrol of
anumberher. this companyrt approved the decision of the privy companyncil in
bjordals case that directors qua directors are number
without the pale of the public. this companyrt pointed out that
what one has to find out is whether there is an individual
who or a group acting in companycert which companytrols or companytrol
the affairs of the companypany to the exclusion of others by
reason of his or their voting power. such person or group
of persons do number answer the description public. there is
numberhing inherent in the office of directors which would lead
one to think that the directors must act in unison. they
are persons in whom the shareholder have reposed
confidence and on whom they have companyferred powers which
under the scheme of the companypanies act have to be exercised
for the benefit
 1  1961 41 1. t. r. 667.
of the shareholders. the directors are in a manner of
speaking trustees of these powers. it is the duty of the
directors to exercise these powers to the best of their
independent judgment. there is therefore .-numberhing in the
nature of things or at all that requires the directors to
act in unison. this companyrt pointed out in the raghuvanshi
millscase  1  that such a group may be companyposed of
directors or their numberinees or relations in different
combinations or may be companyposed of persons numbere of whom is a
director provided such a group forms a block which holds the
controlling interest in its hands. it would therefore follow from what we have stated that we
have first to see whether there is an individual or a group
holding the companytrolling interest which group acting in
concert can direct the affairs of  lie companypany at its will. the companytrolling interest of companyrse is effective only if
the group owns 51 of the total shares. but the companypany will
still lie a companypany in which the public can be said to be
substantially interested because lo cease to be so the
holding of the group must be more than 75 . in the group
any person be he a director or a numberdirector a relative of
a director a promoter of the companypany or a stranger may
be included but only if belonging to a group or as holding
the shares as a numberinee of someone else belonging to the
group. we have indicated again the true test which was number
applied in the judgment of the bombay high companyrt in the
raghuvansi mills case -  and applying which we reversed
that decision. applying the above test we have to see whether there is
such a group in this companypany. it is obvious from what we
have said that category a which companysisted of the directors
could number be regarded as outside public merely by reason
that they were directors. but there is however an
intimate companynection between category a and category b in
as much as both are members of the managing agency

firm. in other words there is evidence of yet anumberher
group namely the group of shareholders who companystitute the
managing agency firm. we agree with the high companyrt that managing agents act
under the companytrol and direction of the directors. the
managing agents are also appointed by the companypany. the
control of the affairs of a companypany is ordinarily in the
hand of the directors of the companypany but there may be cases
in which the managing agents by reason of their superior
holding of shares may be able to appoint the directors and
generally to companytrol the views of the directors. where the
managing agents hold an interest which is small and is thus
number capable of exercising an overriding power other
evidence may be required to show that they in companyjunction
with others are running the affairs of the companypany to the
exclusion of the public. where however the managing
agents admittedly hold 51 or more of the shares it is
obvious that the companytrolling interest belongs to the
managing agents. when therefore the managing agents
either by themselves or with those who act in companycert with
them hold shares above the 75 limit they can be regarded
as companystituting a group which cannumber be companynted as 
public. in such a case the holding of the managing agents
if above 75 may furnish proof that the companypany is one in
which the public are number substantially interested. it was
contended before us that even among the managing agents some
may take an independent view. numbermally managing agencies
are number formed by parties except for the purpose of mutual
gain and the companymonness of the interest lends a companyesion. to
the body which enables it to act in its own interest. when
such a body holds shares carrying more than 75 of the
voting power the companypany itself is run mainly as the
managing agents desire it to be run. such a managing agency
could easily choose its own directors and the directors
would number be independent persons but mere numberinees of the
managing agents. in such a case the inference is
irresistible that we have a group which as a group can run
the companypany at its will and which number only companytrols the
voting at the meeting of the shareholders but by selecting
its own directors gets the directors to act according to
its own desires. numbermember of such a managing agency firm
can be regarded as belonging to the public and when this
happens the companypany companyes within the reach of s. 23a. applying the above test to the present case it is clear
that the managing agents between them hold 77128 out of
100000 ordinary shares well above the limit. they have
in addition 1250 first preference shares out of 5000 which
also carry voting power. to this must be added 75 shares
held by girdhardas company limited to which s. 23a is admittedly
applicable. this brings the total holding to 78453. 75 of
the total shares bearing votes is 78750. this shows that
the holding of the managing agents is short by 298 shares
for the application of the explanation to s. 23a. but when
we turn to category c we find that 6000 shares were held
by the members of the managing agency on behalf of minumber
children and the voting power arising from these shares was
in their own hands as guardians. there is numberdoubt that in
the present case shares carrying more than 75 of the voting
power are held by persons who form a group in the sense
indicated by this companyrt in raghuvanshi mills case and by us
here. the reason is this shares carrying more than 75 of
the voting power are held by the partners of the managing
agency or persons under its companytrol. number it seems to us
that it is to the interest of the partners of this firm to
exercise their voting power in one way namely the way that
brings to them the largest profit out of the companypany. it is
true that the managing agents are the servants of the
company in a manner of speaking and number its masters and also
that the object of a firm of managing agents is to carry out
certain administrative
duties companycerning the companypany under the companytrol of the
directors of the companypany. that however is irrelevant and in
any case is far from the truth in the present case. here
the partners of the managing agency practically own the
company. at the hearing a point was raised that it has to be proved
as a fact that the persons companystituting the oil which owns
shares carrying more than seventyfive percent of the voting
power were acting in unison. the test is number whether they
have actually acted in companycert but whether the circumstances
are such that human experience tells us that it can safely
be taken that they must be acting together. it is number
necessary to state the kind of evidence that will prove such
concerted actings. each case must necessarily be decided on
its own facts. the exclusion of public in the manner
indicated generally from more than 75 of the shares and the
concentration of such a holding in a single person or a
group acting in companycert is what attracts s. 23  a .",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/478357/; https://indiankanoon.org/doc/639353/?type=print,"The case is the exact proceeding—Civil Appeal No. 599 of 1961—described in the base text.  
It illustrates the principle that s. 23A Income-tax Act applies only if a single “group” (here the managing-agency firm and its numberinees) beneficially controls more than 75 % of the voting shares, so the company is not one “in which the public are substantially interested.”  
The Court aggregated the 77 128 ordinary and 1 250 preference shares held by the fourteen partners, plus 6 000 minor’s shares whose votes they controlled, to find 78 453 of 105 000 voting shares—just above the 75 % line.  
Because this cohesive block could dictate dividend policy and appoint its own directors, the company was deemed to lack sufficient public participation; s. 23A was therefore attracted and the deemed-dividend order upheld.  
Thus the judgment operationalises the statutory explanation that once a concerted group crosses the 75 % threshold the exemption is lost, regardless of earlier rebate grants or historical losses.","Because the managing-agency partners and the minors whose votes they controlled together beneficially held 78 453 of the 105 000 voting shares—i.e. more than 75 %—they formed a single “group” that could dictate dividend and director decisions to the exclusion of the public.  That factual concentration of voting control, the statutory cause, triggers the legal effect: the company ceases to be one “in which the public are substantially interested,” so the condition for the proviso to s. 23A fails and the deemed-dividend provision automatically applies."
