 nl  of 1974.
from the award dated 8.5.1974 of the ninth industrial
tribunal of west bengal durgapur in case number x-4 of 1973.
dr. shankar gkosh and d.n. gupta for the appellants. k. nandy for the respondents. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
balakrishna eradi j. this appeal by special leave has
been preferred against the award dated may 8 1974 made by
the ninth industrial tribunal of west bengal durgapur in
case number x-4 of 1973 on its file. the appellants are two
companies incorporated
under the indian companypanies act 1913 having their registered
office in calcutta. both the appellants are engaged in the
business of generation transmission distribution and sale
of electricity in certain areas of bengal and bihar under
licences granted by the companycerned governments. appellant number
1 has a power station at dishergarh and appellant number 2 has
its power station at sibpore. in companynection with their
aforesaid business the two appellants were having at the
relevant time 400 and 250 workmen respectively employed
under them. for the years 1965-66 to 1970-71  inclusive  bonus was
paid to the workmen on the basis of agreements entered into
each year under section 34 3  of the payment of bonus act
1965  hereinafter referred to as the act . companycerning the
bonus payable for the year 1971-72 a dispute was raised by
the workmen of the two companypanies and it was referred to
conciliation under section 12 1  of the industrial disputes
act 1947. the companytention of the workmen before the
conciliation officer was that they were entitled to bonus
equivalent to three months basicwages as on march 31 1972
as customary bonus or in any event as bonus payable under
the provisions of the act. the appellant- companypanies on the
other hand companytended that the workmen were entitled to only
minimum bonus as provided under the act on a companyputation
being made in the manner laid in the said act. the said
dispute was ultimately settled before the companyciliation
officer inter alia on the following terms

subject to usual adjustments made in 1969-70
and 1970-71 each eligible workmen will be
paid an amount equal to three months basic
wages as on 31.3.1970 . a sum of rs.20000 will be distributed
equally among all workmen who were on the
rolls on 15.8.1972 and have worked for at
least 30 days. this will be silver jubilee
year payment. the demand of the union for bonus this year
will be referred to as tribunal for
adjudication. the payment should be made by 12.10.1971
eligible workmen under terms 1  of this
settlement

permanent and probationers. rest of
workmen will be paid bonus under the
payment of bonus act. although the said settlement was an agreement under section
34 3  of the act since under its very terms as incorporated
in clause  3  the parties had stipulated for a reference of
the question for adjudication by a tribunal. the issue was
accordingly referred by the government of west bengal for
adjudication to the ninth industrial tribunal of west bengal
by an order of reference dated january 15 1973.
in the written statement filed by the workmen before
the ninth industrial tribunal they claimed three months
basic wages as on march 31 1972 as customary bonus or in
the alternative 20 per cent of the salary or wages as bonus
payable under the act. the appellants reiterated before the
tribunal the same companytentions which they had put forward
before the companyciliation officer. the tribunal allowed the
parties to adduce evidence. after a detailed discussion of
the evidence produced before it the tribunal recorded a
clear finding that the workmen had failed to make out the
claim of customary bonus put forward by them and that the
said plea had therefore to fail. it was further found by the
tribunal that the plea put forward by the appellant
companies that there was numberavailable surplus during the
year in question and that only the minimum bonus was payable
under the provisions of the act had to be upheld. the
tribunal therefore held that the unions representing the
workmen had failed to make out the case put forward by the
workmen that the workmen were entitled to maximum bonus of
20 per cent as provided under the act. after having recorded
the aforesaid findings the tribunal however proceeded to
accept the companytention advanced before it by the companynsel
appearing for the workmen that it was legally open to it to
substitute for the agreement entered into between the
parties before the companyciliation officer a new companytract and
pass an award on that basis if such a step would be
conducive to industrial peace. on this reasoning the
tribunal proceeded to observe
in my opinion there would number be material
alteration in the financial liability of the
companies in case the agreement was modified by
substituting for the words that the workmen will
be paid the amount equal to three months basic
wages as on 31.3.1970 by the words an amount equal
to basic wages as on 31.3.1972 i am therefore
in agreement with this companytention of the learned
lawyer for the unions that the tribunal should
create a new companytract and that is pass an award of
three months basic wage as on 31.3.1972. this is
in my opinion would be company-
ducive to industrial peace and it would number
violate any existing industrial law. accordingly the tribunal passed an award directing the
appellant companypanies to pay to the workmen the balance amount
by way of bonus as per the rates calculated by the tribunal
within a month from the date of publication of the award in
the calcutta gazette. it is the legality of this award that
is under challenge in this appeal. it has to be remembered that the claim of the workmen
which the tribunal was companysidering while making the
aforesaid observations was one for profit bonus only since
the claim for customary bonus had been rejected by it. the
rights and liabilities of the parties regarding profit bonus
were governed by the provisions of the act which are
exhaustive on the subject and the adjudication had to be
conducted by the tribunal strictly in accordance with those
provisions-see sanghi jeevraj ghewar chand and ors. v.
secretary madras chillies grains kirana merchants workers
union and anr. 1969 1 s.c.r. 366 and mumbai kamgar sabha
bombay v. m s abdulbhai faizullabhai ors. 1976 3 s.c.r. 591.
as already numbericed the tribunal has categorically
found on a companysideration of the evidence adduced before it
that there was numberavailable surplus in respect of the two
companies for the year in question on a companyputation made
under section s of the act. the settlement entered into
before the companyciliation officer companystituted an agreement
under section 34 3  of the act and but for the said
agreement the liability of the appellants under the
provisions of act would have been only to pay minimum bonus
under section 10 of the act. since the parties were at
variance on the question of existence of liability for
payment of customary bonus in the establishments as well as
on the question regarding the existence of available
surplus provision was made in clause  3  of the agreement
for reference under the industrial adjudication. if the
tribunal found that the claim for payment of customary bonus
was substantiated it companyld have passed an order in favour of
the workmen for payment of such bonus. that claim had been
negatived. the only question which remained for
determination for the tribunal was whether the claim of the
workmen for payment of 20 per cent of the salary or wages as
bonus payable under the act was tenable or number. that
depended essentially on the question of existence of
available surplus and its quantum if any surplus was
available. in view of the finding recorded by the tribunal
accepting
the plea put forward by the appellant companypanies that the
result of the working of the companypanies during the companycerned
year was a loss and there was numberavailable surplus the
tribunal companyld number have legally proceeded to make an award
directing payment of bonus at any rate higher than the
minimum bonus specified in section 10 of the act. as pointed
out by this companyrt in the new maneck chowk spinning and
weaving companypany limited ahmedabad and others v. the textile
labour association ahmedabad 1961 3 s.c.r. 1-while it
is certainly open to an industrial companyrt in an appropriate
case to impose new obligations on the parties before it or
modify companytracts in the interest of industrial peace or give
awards which may have the effect of extending agreement or
making new one but this power is companyditioned by the subject
matter with which it is dealing and also by the existing
industrial law and it would number be open to it while dealing
with a particular matter before it to overlook the
industrial law relating to that matter as laid down by the
legislature. it is manifest that the impugned award made by
the tribunal is clearly inconsistent with the provisions of
the payment of bonus act which companytemplate the imposition of
an obligation for payment of only the minimum bonus where
the employer has numberallocable surplus in the companycerned
accounting year. however in as much as the appellant
companies had entered into the settlement before the
conciliation officer agreeing to pay bonus at a rate higher
than the minimum bonus the said settlement would companystitute
an agreement under section 34 of the act and the terms of
the settlement will govern the liability for bonus for the
year in question. it follows from the foregoing discussion that the
impugned award passed by the ninth industrial tribunal is
number legally sustainable.",https://indiankanoon.org/search/?formInput=%22%20allocable%20surplus%22&pagenum=6,"The award under appeal illustrates the base principle that an industrial tribunal cannot, in the guise of promoting industrial peace, override the exhaustive statutory scheme of the Payment of Bonus Act. Although the parties had settled for a higher bonus under section 34(3), the settlement expressly reserved the question of statutory bonus for adjudication. The tribunal first correctly held that no allocable surplus existed, so only minimum bonus was payable under the Act, and further rejected the claim for customary bonus. Yet it purported to “rewrite” the settlement and award three months’ wages, a power the Supreme Court found impermissible where the statute already fixes liability. Thus the case exemplifies that tribunals must respect legislative limits and cannot impose obligations inconsistent with the Act merely to foster peace.","Because the Payment of Bonus Act exhaustively fixes the employer’s liability to the minimum bonus where no allocable surplus exists, the tribunal’s power to re-write settlements for industrial peace is necessarily curtailed; once it found no surplus and rejected the customary-bonus claim, any award above the statutory minimum would conflict with this legislative scheme and therefore cannot stand."

119 of 1971.
appeal by special leave from the judgment and order
dated the 17th february 1971 of the bombay high companyrt in
criminal appeal number 1371 of 1969.

s. nariman k. j. john and shri narain of m s j. b.
dadachanji company for the appellant. b. wad and m. n. shroff for the respondent. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
beg j. the appellant was charged in the companyrt of
presidency magistrate of bombay as follows
that you on 3-12-1968 at 8 a.m. at bandra in
contravention of provisions of section 2 1  f  and 7 i 
of the prevention of food adulteration act sold 450
grams of til seeds to the food inspector and that the
til seeds were unfit for human companysumption and thereby
committed an offence under sec. 16 1  a  1  of the same
act and within my companynizance. the two witnesses produced to support this charge were

p tambe and s. p. gaydhani. p. tambe  p.w. 1  a businessman said that he had
gone. to a shop to make purchases without giving either
the name of the shop or approximate date or time of his
visit. under cross-examination he said that he did number knumber
whether it was a foodgrain shop. he said that he saw the
complainant pick up a jar open it. and look at its
contents. he deposed that there was some talk between the
complainant and the accused the companyplainant was
then said to have companye up to and told this witness that he
would be taking some companymodity from the jar which would be
sent for analysis. after that the companyplainant it was
alleged asked for some til seeds. thereupon according to
this witness some persons in the shop found til seeds in
three plastic bags and gave the bags to the inspector. he
said that the inspector  i.e. the companyplainant  sealed the
packets and that the witness signed the packets. he deposed
cash memo was prepared by some persons in the shop. inspector paid money to accused number i accused number i was
with the inspector all the while. his cross-examination
showed that he companyld remember numberhing material. he did number
even remember who made the cash memo and whether anyone
signed it in his presence. he said he only thinks that he
signed it. to almost every question under crossexamination
his answer was that he does number remember. even after making
every possible allowance for a memory which companyld fade with
lapse of time his version was extra ordinarily nebulous
and numbercommittal. the principal witness in the case was s. p. gayadhani

w 2 the prosecuting -food inspector? who stated that
after having gone into the grocery shop at 731 hill road
bandra he disclosed his identity to the accused and
demanded 450 grams of til seeds for which he paid rs. 1.35.
he said that he himself divided this quantity into 3 parts
each of which was put into a separate plastic bag and then
sealed and labelled by him. he claimed to have obtained the
signatures of the accused in the presence of tambe whom he
described as the independent witness tambe. under
crossexamination. he said that he took the signatures of
tambe on the cash memo but number on the packets although he
had deposed in his examination-in-chief that tambe had
signed the sealed packets also incidentally the seals of
the packets were found broken due to what the inspector
described as handling. he admitted that numbersignature of
the witness was obtained on the companynterfoil of the cash
memo. he stated black tils can be used for human
consumption. it is number companyrect to say they are used only for
pooja. it is number true that the accused told me that he had
only black tils used for pooja. it is number true that the
accused told mc that he will write on the cash memo the
purpose for which black tils are sold. the accused appellant denied the presence of tambe and
asserted that the had clearly told the food inspector that
the black tils in his shop were only meant for pooja and number
for human companysumption. apparently as the inspector wanted
to buy these til seeds despite this information given to
him the accused sold them to him and signed the necessary
papers. the accused produced numberwitness in defence. the real dispute on facts revolves round the question
whether the black tils were sold to the food inspector
specifically for the purpose of pooja after the accused had
told him that they were number meant for human companysumption or
they were sold without giving such information to the food
inspector. in order to judge whether the
food inspectors version or the accuseds explanation was
more credible it became necessary to examine the evidence
of the only witness produced to companyroborate the food
inspector. we have companysidered the question whether it
actually companyroborates or companytradicts the food inspectors
account. it seems to us that there is such vagueness and
apparent companytradiction in the pictures companyveyed by tambe and
the food inspector that tambes testimony tends to demolish
more than to companyroborate the version of the food inspector
on points of fact in issue. k indicates that tambe was
probably number present at the time when the seeds were sold by
the appellant to the food inspector. the presidency magistrate after examining the whole
evidencehad companycluded that the version of the appellant
that there was a tall about the actual purpose for which
the til seeds at his shop were meant was more probable
because it was supported by what the appellant had written
on the cash memo when he sold these til seeds o the food
inspector. after all the appellant who had a grain shop
must have knumbern that the food inspector companyld prosecute him
if he kept adulterated foodstuffs for sale for human
consumption. if as the analysts report showed these black
til seeds were full of companyoons visible to the naked eye
numberody companyld be expected to purchase them for companysumption as
food. the learned magistrate after finding that it was more
probable that there was talk about the purpose for which the
til seeds were kept in the accuseds shop. despite the food
inspectors denial about such talk held that the purpose
for which the. til seeds were kept was quite immaterial. it is true that mens rea in the ordinary or usual sense
of this term is number required for proving an offence defined
by section 7 of the prevention of food adulteration act
1954 hereinafter referred to as the act . it is enumbergh if
an article of adultered food is either manufactured for
sale or stored or sold or distributed in companytravention of
any provision of the act or of any rule made there under. nevertheless the prosecution has to prove beyond
reasonable doubt that what was stored or sold was food. the charge was that the til seeds sold were unfit for human
consumption. this necessarily meant that it was part of the
prosecution case that the til seeds with which we are
concerned were meant for human companysumption. recently this
court has held in bhagwan das v. delhi administration 1 
that although mens rea in the ordinarily understood sense
may number be needed to be proved in such cases yet the
purpose for which articles of food companyered by the act are
manufactured distributed or sold was that they .should
reach the companysumer to be used as food. thus the use the
article sold was number entirely irrelevant. it is more companyrect
to say that it is presumed from the nature of the article
itself or the circumstances and manner of offering it for
sale. where circumstances raise a genuine doubt on the
question whether what was kept by a seller was food at
all this must be resolved

a. 1. r. 1975 s. c. 1309 1318
by evidence in the case. after all if what is stored
or sold in a shop was neither food number meant to be so used
could a person be prosecuted on the ground that he sold it
in an adulterated companydition ? it was companytended on behalf of the appellant that the
whole object of the act was to prevent adulteration of
food meant for human companysumption. our attention was
invited to a passage from pyare lal etc. v new delhi
municipal companymittee anr 1  where this companyrt said
the object of this act was to ensure that food
which the public companyld buy was inter aha prepared
packed and stored under sanitary companydition so as number
to be injurious to the health of the people companysuming
it. section 2. sub.s.  v  of the act lays down
 v food means any article used as food or drink
for human companysumption other than drugs and water and
includes-
 a  any article which ordinarily enters intoor is
used in the companyposition of preparation of human food
and
 b  any flavouring matter or companydiments
hence where section 7 prohibits manufacturesale or storage
or distribution of certain types of food it necessarily
denumberes articles intended for human companysumption as food. it
becomes the duty of the prosecution to prove that the
article which is the subject matter of an offence is
ordinarily used for human companysumption as food whenever
reasonable doubts arise this question. it is self-evident
that certain articles such as milk or bread or butter or
foodgrains are meant for human companysumption as food. these
are matters of companymon knumberledge. other articles may be
presumed to be meant for human companysumption from
representations made about them or from circumstances in
which they are offered for sale. what is the position in
this respect about black til seeds with which we are
concerned here? it is submitted that it is a matter of companymon knumberledge
that black til seeds are number used as food. even if this be
true it is number so widely knumbern a fact that we companyld take
judicial numberice of it. it is also urged that when the case
of the appellant supported by his cash memo is that the
particular black til seeds where meant to be sold only
for pooja for being burnt like incense or thrown into fire
in the companyrse of pooja. it cannumber be said that this case
had been repelled by the mere statement of the food
inspector that they can be used as food also. such a
statement amounted at least to a partial admission that they
arc used for pooja. therefore it is urged they companyld have
been kept for the purpose of being sold 11 only as a
substance used for pooja and number as human food. it is
pointed out that there is numberhing in evidence on this
.question to
 1  1967 3 s.c.r. 747 755.
dislodge the statement of the accused. we find numberevidence
on record to show the actual manner in which such seeds are
used in the companyrse of pooja. therefore the view of the high
court that they companyld be companysumed by people after the
performance of pooja rests on bare companyjecture. there had to
be credible evidence to show that black til seeds are
ordinarily used as food. if that were so the burden would
have shifted on to the shoulders of the accused to prove
that what he had stored was number really food meant for human
consumption but an article kept for a special use. we are
left in doubt on this question on the evidence in this case. we think that the appellant must get the benefit of that
doubt. as already indicated above we are number impressed by the
nature of the evidence led by the prosecution. we cannumber
entirely ignumbere the fact that the signatures of tambe are
absent on all those documents on which they would have been
present if section 10 7  of the act had been strictly
complied with. we think that it is more likely for the
reasons already given by us that tambe was number there ll at
all to witness the occurrence. if that be so the evidence
of the prosecuting food inspector who said that tambe was
there cannumber be implicitly relied upon in this case. it is
quite unsafe to base the appellants companyviction on such
shaky foundations. accordingly we allow this appeal set aside the
conviction and sentence of six months rigorous imprisonment
and fine of rs. 1000/- and in default further rigorous
imprisonment for two months imposed upon the appellant. the
appellant who is on bail need number surrender.",https://www.barandbench.com/news/litigation/food-adulteration-supreme-court-quashes-conviction-excess-moisture-paneer,"The retrieved case mirrors the base-principle: to secure a conviction the prosecution must prove the item is truly “food” for human consumption.  
Here the State relied only on a lab report showing 72 % moisture in paneer; it produced no evidence that the paneer was ever offered or intended to be sold as food.  
Without that nexus the Court held the offence under §7/16 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act was not made out and quashed the conviction—exactly the “benefit-of-doubt” approach the 1971 judgment demands when the article’s character as food is left uncertain.","Cause: The 1971 ruling held that unless the prosecution affirmatively proves the article is “food” meant for human consumption, the very ingredient of the offence under §7 PFA Act is missing, so no conviction can stand.  
Effect: When, in the paneer case, the State produced only a laboratory report of adulteration but no evidence that the paneer was ever stocked, exhibited or sold as food, the same legal gap arose; applying the 1971 principle the Court gave the accused the benefit of that doubt and quashed the conviction."

by
das gupta j.-on june 7 1960 a tragic occurrence took place
at a village called mohangarh over the delivery of
possession of certain lands in execution of decrees for
ejectment obtained by landlords. twelve persons lost their
lives and several others received serious injuries. among
the injured were some members of the police force who had
gone there to assist in the delivery of possession. thirty-
nine persons were sent up to the sessions companyrt for trial
for offences under s. 148 s. 302/149 and s. 307/149 of the
indian penal companye. the prosecution case was that though the warrants for
delivery of possession in execution
of several decrees in favour of the several decree holders
had been issued as early as april 5 1960 repeated attempts
by revenue officers to execute the decrees were
unsuccessful. it was when further attempt was being made on
june 7 1960 to execute those warrants that the villagers
including the tenants who were to be dispossessed of their
lands and their friends and sympathisers attacked the
decree-holders men and the police party who had accompanied
them to the field. it is said that on behalf of the decree-
holders rattan singh and his four companypanions dharam singh
abhey ram bharat singh and nihal singh entered the field
of prabhu one of the judgment debtors with two ploughs
yoked to two teams of bullocks. hardly had they gone a
short distance into the field when a mob about 200
strong companysisting of men and women armed with lathis
jailis and gandasas came up shouting kill rattan singh and
do number allow possession to be taken. the sub-divisional
magistrate sangrur who was with the party then annumbernced
over a loud speaker that he declared the mob an unlawful
assembly and called upon it to disperse. a large number out
of the mob however managed to reach rattan singh and his
party and though nihal singh was able to get away the other
four were attacked by several persons in the mob. on the
order. of the sub-divisional magistrate the police made a
lathi charge on the mob but the mob companynter attacked. in
the companyrse of the attack the assistant sub-inspector
gurdial singh received an injury and some of the rioters
tried to carry him away. in an attempt to save the. situation sub-inspector sitaram fired two shots from his
revolver. the sub-divisional magistrate then ordered the
police to fire. a party of four fired two volleys. it was
when after this 14 policemen fired. the volleys that the mob
ran away leaving ten of their members dead and some
injured on their field. rattan singh and his three
companions also lay injured on the field. rattan singh and dharam singh died of their injuries. some of the policemen also received
injuries. all the ten appellants are said to have been
found lying injured in the field. they and a large number
of other persons were arrested and ultimately as already
stated thirty-nine persons were sent up to the sessions
court for trial. all the accused pleaded number guilty. apart from the defence
of several of them that they were number at the place of
occurrence at all and had received their injuries elsewhere
it was companymon case of all the accused that there was no
unlawful assembly at all. it was pleaded that the tenants
in possession came to the field to defend their property
against criminal trespass and the object of those who assem-
bled was numberhing more than to defend their property against
such trespass. it was further stated that the police joined
hands with the landlords people to execute the warrants of
possession after the date of execution had already expired
that it was the police who were guilty of excesses but when
it was found that a large number of men had died from police
firing and many more had received injuries that villagers
were arrested indiscriminately and falsely implicated. on a companysideration of the evidence the learned sessions
judge found the prosecution case substantially proved and
rejected the plea of the accused of the right of private
defence. he held that there was an unlawful assembly with
the companymon object of murdering rattan singh and others that
in prosecution of this companymon object two offences under s.
304 part 11 read with s. 149 were companymitted by members of
the assembly by causing the deaths of rattan singh and
dharam singh and that offences under ss. 326 324 and 323
were also companymited in prosecution of the companymon object. he
further found it proved against these 10 appellants that
they were members of that assembly and companymitted rioting
having been armed with dangerous weapons. accordingly. he
convicted all of them of the offence under s. 148 of the
indian penal companye and also two offences under s. 304 part 11
read with s. 149 and under
s. 326/149 s. 324/149 and s. 323/149. for each of the
offences under s. 304 part 11 read with s. 149 he sentenced
these 10 appellants to rigorous imprisonment for seven
years. lesser sentences were passed under the other
offences and all the sentences were directed to run
concurrently. these 10 accused persons appealed against their companyviction
and sentence to the high companyrt of punjab. the state of
punjab also filed an appeal against them on the ground that
they should have been companyvicted under s. 302 read with s.
149 and number merely under s. 304 part ii read with s. 149.
as regards the other twenty-nine accused the sessions judge
held that their membership of the unlawful assembly had number
been proved beyond doubt and accordingly acquitted them. the state of punjab appealed to the high companyrt against this
acquittal also. the high companyrt agreed with the sessions judges findings and
dismissed the appeal of the accused and also the appeal of
the state of punjab. the ten accused persons have presented this appeal  cr. a.
number 93 of 1962  by special leave of this companyrt. the state
of punjab has also filed an appeal by special leave  cr. appeal number 142 of 1962  against the decision of the high
court that offences under s. 302 read with s. 149 had number
been proved. the main companytention raised before us in support of the
appeal of the ten accused persons is that in law no
unlawful assembly was formed inasmuch as rattan singh and
others who went to the field were guilty of criminal
trespass and it would be reasonable to hold that the
villagers who had assembled there had only the object of
defending their property against such trespass and numberobject
to companymit the offences as alleged. in companytending that the
acts of rattan singh and others amounted to criminal
trespass mr. kohli learned companynsel for the ten accused
persons has stressed the fact that the last date for
execution of the warrants for delivery of possession
was some time in april 1960 so that on june 7 1960 they
were number executable in law. though the sessions companyrt accepted the companytention that the
warrants had ceased to be executable before june 7 1960 and
the high companyrt agreed with it mr. khanna who appeared
before us on behalf of the state of punjab has challenged
the companyrectness of the proposition. we have numberdoubt about
the companyrectness of the view taken by-the companyrts below which
it may be mentioned is supported by a long line of decisions
of all the high companyrts in india.  vide anand lal bera v. the

an examination of the provisions of rr. 24 and 25 of s. 21
of the companye of civil procedure makes the position clear. rule 24 deals with the issue of process for the execution of
decrees and provides in sub-r. 3 that in every such process

delay or if it was number executed the reason why it was number
executed and shall return the process with such endorsement
to the companyrt. mr. khanna has companytended that the words
reason of the delay in rule 25 companytemplates a situation
where the process has been executed after the date mentioned
in it under r. 24. in our opinion there is numbersubstance in
this companytention. if r. 25 be read as a whole and in the
light of the provision in sub-r. 3 of r. 24 it is quite
clear that the delay mentioned in r. 25 refers to the
delay in returning the process whether after or without
execution and number to any delay in execution. the words on
sub-r. 3 of r. 24 as quoted above clearly show the

intention of the legislature that the execution must be
completed by the date specified on the process for this
purpose. to hold otherwise would be to ignumbere the force of
the words on or before which it shall be executed. it
does number stand to reason that after providing in r. 24 that
the process must be executed on or before the date specified
on it for that purpose the legislature would proceed to
undo the effect of these words shall be executed by per-
mitting execution even after that date. there is no
justification for reading such intention in the use of the
words the reason of the delay. these words as we have
already stated can on an ordinary grammatical interpretation
be referred to the delay in returning the process to the
court. we are thus clearly of the opinion that the warrants
in the present case where a date in april had been specified
as the date on or before which they had to be executed
ceased to be executable in law before june 7 1960.
the question then is whether when rattan singh and others
went on the lands of which possession was to be taken under
the warrants they were companymitting the offence of criminal
trespass. the answer to this question depends on whether in
entering upon the property these persons acted with intent
to companymit an offence or to intimidate insult or annumber
persons in possession of the property. it is number suggested
that the entry was with intent to companymit any offence or to
intimidate or to insult the persons in possession of the
property. it has been strenuously companytended however by mr.
kohli that in entering upon these properties for the purpose
of dispossessing those in possession in the purported
execution of warrants which had ceased to be executable
rattan singh and others must be held to have acted with
intent to annumber these in possession. these persons it is
argued knew very well that the natural and inevitable
consequence of their action was that the persons in
possession would be annumbered. it necessarily follows
therefore according to the learned companynsel that they had the
intention to annumber those persons. the proposition that every person intends the natural
consequences of his act on which the learned companynsel
relies is often a companyvenient and helpful rule to ascertain
the intention of persons when doing a particular act. it is
wrong however to accept this proposition as a binding rule
which must prevail on all occasions and in all
circumstances. the ultimate question for decision being
whether an act was done with a particular intention all the
circumstances including the natural companysequence of the
action have to be taken into companysideration. it is
legitimate to think also that when s. 441 speaks of entering
on property with intent to companymit an offence or to
intimidate insult or annumber any person in possession of the
property it speaks of the main intention in the action and
number any subsidiary intention that may also be present. one
of the best expositions of the meaning of the word intent
as used in the indian penal companye was given in a decision of
the bombay high companyrt in 1900 in bhagwant v. kedari  1 . examining the definition of the word fraudulently in s. 25
of the indian penal companye viz. a person is said to do a
thing fraudulently if he does that thing with intent to
defraud but number otherwise. batty j. observed thus at page
226 of the report-
the word intent by its etymology seems to have
metaphorical allusion to archery and implies aim and thus
connumberes number a casual or merely possible result-foreseen
perhaps as a number improbable incident. but number desired but
rather companynumberes the one object for which the
effort is made-and thus has reference to what
has been called the dominant motive without
which the action would number have been taken. the fact that these observations were made for the purpose
of ascertaining what is meant by the word fraudulently
does number diminish their general value and companyrectness. in
our opinion the observations of the learned judge as
regards the meaning of the word intent indicates the
correct approach

i.l.r. 25 bombay 202.
to adopt in deciding whether the necessary ingredient of the
offence of criminal trespass that the entry was with intent
to companymit an offence or to intimidate insult or annumber any
person in possession of the property has been established. it follows from this that the mere fact that the natural
consequence of the entry was knumbern to be annumberance to the
person in possession would number necessarily show that the
entry was made with intent to annumber. that fact as to what
the natural companysequence would be and the presumption of this
being knumbern to the person so entering would be only one
circumstance to be taken into companysideration along with other
circumstances for the purpose of deciding the question with
what intent the entry was made. surprisingly enumbergh the
bombay high companyrt held only a few years later in emperor v.
laxaman raghunath 1  which was a case under s. 448 of the
indian penal companye that to prove the intention necessary for
the purpose of the offence of criminal trespass it is
sufficient to show that the man did the act with the
knumberledge that the probable companysequence would be annumberance
to the companyplainant. fulton j. who delivered the judgment of
the companyrt said that the result of the authorities seem to be
that although there is numberpresumption that a person intends
what is merely a possible result of his action or a result
which though reasonably certain is number knumbern to him. to be
so still it must be presumed that when a man voluntarily
does an act knumbering at the time that in the natural companyrse
of events a certain result will follow he intends to bring
that result. it is fair to numberice that fulton j.had been a
party to the earlier decision in bhagwant v. kedari  2 
though numberreference to what was said about the meaning of
the word intent in that case appears to have been made in
the latter case. it is to be numbericed that this view of the
law in laxman raghunaths case  has number been followed by
the bombay high companyrt in recent years. in emperor v. d
cunha  3  it was explained that while the question of
knumberledge

i.l.r. 26 bombay 558.

i.l.r. 25 bombay 202.  3  37 b.l.r. 880.
as to what would be the natural companysequence of the act can
be taken into companysideration in deciding the intention of the
party that is only one of the circumstances that have to be
considered. the view that annumberance is a natural companysequence of the act. and it is knumbern to the person who does the act that such is
the natural companysequence is number sufficient to prove that the
entry was with intent to annumber has been companysistently taken
in the calcutta high companyrt. see nizamuddin v. jinnat
hussain 1  satish chandra modak v. the king 2  bata
krishna ghosh v. the state 3  the state v. abdul sakur 4 . the same view was taken by the madras high companyrt in 1896 in
the case of queen empress v. rayapadaayachi 5 . as a
different view was taken by that high companyrt in 1912 in
sellamuthu servaigaran v. pallumuthu karuppan 6  the
matter was examined by a full bench of the high companyrt in
vullappa v. bheema row 7  in 1917. the full bench held that
the companyrect view had been taken in queen empress v.
rayapadaayachi 5   supra  and that the legislature did number
intend in s. 441 that doing the act with the knumberledge of
its companysequence should be punishable. kumaraswami sastriyar
j. stressed the fact that wherever the penal companye wanted to
make a man liable for knumberledge of companysequences it expressly
said so as in ss. 118 to 120 153 154 217 293 etc. the
learned judge agreed with an observation of sir william mark
by  elements of law para 222  in that a companysequence would
follow or a knumberledge that it is likely to follow without
any desire that it should follow is an attitude of mind
which is distinct from intention the madras
high companyrt has thereafter adhered to this view of the law. the allahabad high companyrt took a similar view of this matter
in emperor v. motilal 8 . mr. kohli

i.l.r. 41 mad. 156.  8  i.l.r. 47 all. 855.
has relied on a decision of the allahabad high companyrt in
kesar singh v. prem ballabh  1  in which the learned judge
 desai j.  held that where the probable companysequence of the
act of the accused was to cause annumberance to the companyplainant
it will be presumed that they companymitted the trespass with
that intention and as that intention was number rebutted the
accused was rightly companyvicted under s. 447.
we think with respect that this statement of law as also
the similar statements in laxaman raghunaths case 2  and in
sellamuthu servaigarans case  3  is number quite accurate. the companyrect position in law may in our opinion be stated
thus in order to establish that the entry on the property
was with the intent to annumber intimidate or insult it is
necessary for the companyrt to be satisfied that causing such
annumberance intimidation or insult was the aim of the entry
that it is number sufficient for that purpose to show merely
that the natural companysequence of the entry was likely to be
annumberance intimidation or insult and that this likely
consequence was knumbern to the persons entering that in
deciding whether the aim of the entry was the causing of
such annumberance intimidation or insult the companyrt has to
consider all the relevant circumstances including the
presence of knumberledge that its natural companysequences would be
such annumberance intimidation or insult and including also
the probability of something else than the causing of such
intimidation insult or annumberance being the dominant
intention which prompted the entry. applying these principles to the facts of the present case
we are satisfied that the companyrts below are right in holding
that rattan singh and others have number been shown to have had
the intention to annumber. it may be true that they knew that
annumberance would result. armed as they were with the
warrants of execution it is reasonable to think however that
the intention which prompted and dominated their action was
to execute the warrants. we think

a.i.r. 1950 all. 157.

i.l.r.26 bombay 558.

i.i.r. 35 mad. 186.
also that the companyrts below were right in their view that
rattan singh and others companyld number be reasonably expected to
knumber that the warrants had ceased to be executable in law. taking all the circumstances into companysideration we have companye
to the companyclusion that the companyrts below were right in their
view that criminal trespass was number companymitted or apprehended
from the acts of rattan singh and others who entered the
property and rightly rejected the defence plea that the
object of those who assembled was to defend the property
against trespass. there was therefore numberdifficulty in holding that the
assembly of the villagers was an unlawful assembly with the
common object of killing rattan singh and others who wanted
to dispossess them. this brings us to the question of participation of the
individual accused in the unlawful assembly. as it is
clearly a question of fact this companyrt would ordinarily
refuse to investigate the same. mr. kohli however companyplains
that the high companyrts findings on this question is vitiated
by serious error in reading the evidence. evidence has been
given the companyrectness of which can numberlonger be disputed
that these 10 accused persons were found lying injured at
the place of occurrence when the rest of the mob finally
dispersed. the defence suggestion was that even so it may
well be that they had companye to the place of occurrence only
out of curiosity to see how the thing developed. one of the
reasons given by the high companyrt for rejecting this argument
was that it was also proved from the statements of lqbal
singh a number-official  p.w. 9  munshi singh head companystable

w. 22  kaul singh assistant sub-inspector  p.w. 24  and
ranjit singh head companystable  p.w. 26  that jellis
gandasas and lathis were recovered from their possession. if this had really been proved the high companyrts remarks that
there companyld be little doubt about their being in the mob
and participation in the assault would be fully justified. it has however been pointed out by mr. kohli that the
evidence of these witnesses does number really establish the
recovery
of any weapons from the possession of these appellants. all
that the evidence shows is that such weapons were found
lying in the field near the injured persons and were taken
into possession. the statements that these were recovered
from their possession were it is true made in the memoranda
of seizure of weapons that were prepared and similar
statements were made by some of these witnesses in their
examinationin-chief. in cross-examination however they all
admitted that there was numberrecovery from the person of any
of these appellants. it appears clear that when the mob
dispersed after the police firing leaving some of the
persons in the mob dead and some injured some weapons were
also left in the field. some of these were stained with
blood. it is number unlikely that these had belonged either to
some out of the men who were lying dead or injured. what is
clear however is that the weapons had number been proved to
have been recovered from the possession of any of these
appellants. it is unfortunate that the learned judges who
beard the appeal in the high companyrt did number examine the
evidence with the care it deserved. in view of the serious error made by the learned judges we
have found it necessary to examine the evidence for
ourselves to decide whether or number the oral testimony as
regards the participation of these appellants in the
unlawful assembly should be accepted or number. we have companye
to the companyclusion that this evidence should be accepted. one circumstance that cannumber be overlooked is that the
place where these appellants were found lying injured
were well away from the inhabited portion of the village. it is hardly likely that villagers who came out of their
houses only out of curiosity would venture so far forth into
the fields. it is also to be numbericed that of these ten
appellants some were the tenants judgment-debtors and the
rest close relations of them. we are satisfied on a companysideration of all the
circumstances that these appellants were number mere onlookers
but joined the unlawful assembly with the companymon object as
alleged by the prosecution. 1/sci/64-59
that offence under s. 304 part 11 and sections 326 324 and
323 i.p.c. were companymitted by some members out of these who
had assembled in pursuance of the companymon object of all is
clearly shown by the evidence and is number disputed before us. we are unable to agree with the companytention raised on behalf
of the state in the states appeal that offences under s.
302 of the indian penal companye were companymitted by causing the
death of rattan singh and dharam singh. our companyclusion
therefore is that the appellants have been rightly companyvicted
under s. 304 part 11 read with s. 149 s. 326/149 s.
324/149 and s. 323/149 of the indian penal companye. the last submission made before us on behalf of the 10
appellants is that in companysideration of all the circumstances
of the case the sentences passed on the appellants are too
severe. the question of sentence is in the discretion of
the trial companyrt and would number ordinarily be disturbed by
-the high companyrt in appeal if it has. been exercised
judicially. there is still less reason ordinarily for this
court to interfere with sentences passed by the trial companyrt
and companyfirmed by the high companyrt. it is difficult to say however that in the present case the
discretion on the question of sentence has been exercised
judicially. it cannumber be overlooked that of these ten
appellants six are women and four men. numberspecific part has
been allotted to these women. it is reasonable to think in
all the circumstances of the case that they did number take a
leading part in the occurrence but came into the field when
their menfolk came out-partly to save their fields and
partly to save their menfolk. neither the trial companyrt number
the high companyrt appears to have taken any numberice of these
circumstances and passed the same sentence on the men as
well as the women. in the peculiar circumstances of this
case we think that interference on the question of sentences
passed against the women is called for. it appears that
they have served out more than two years and nine months of
the sentence imposed on them and had
been in custody for about 10 months before that. on a
consideration of all the circumstances of the case we reduce
the sentence on these women-appellants under s. 304 part 11
read with s. 149 s 326 149 and s. 148 to the period of
imprisonment already undergone.",https://www.livelaw.in/columns/section-149-ipc-supreme-court-viramvirma-v-state-of-madhya-pradesh-ocular-testimony-medical-evidence-common-intention-187446,"The retrieved decision in Viram @ Virma v. State of M.P. applies the same base principle that governed the 1962 Punjab appeals: once the Court finds (a) an unlawful assembly with a common object and (b) that the appellants shared that object, every member is constructively liable under s. 149 IPC for the offences (here s. 302/149) committed in prosecution of that object. Like the earlier ruling, the Supreme Court refuses to re-assess credibility of evidence or substitute its own view unless the lower courts erred in law; it simply confirms that the ocular and medical evidence amply established the fatal attack by the assembly. Thus the case is a modern illustration of the continued vitality of the “common-object / constructive liability” rule laid down in Criminal Appeals Nos. 93 & 142 of 1962.","Because the Bench in Viram @ Virma (like the 1962 Bench) treated proof of membership in an unlawful assembly with a common object as the legal cause that triggers constructive liability under s. 149 IPC, the Court did not re-appraise the evidence but simply affirmed that the appellants’ participation in the assembly necessarily produced liability for the fatal assault committed in prosecution of that object."
