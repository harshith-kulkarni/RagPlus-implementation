minakshi mrs. urmila kapoor d. goverdhan rakesh k.
khanna salman khurshid r.p. singh d.d. mishra mrs. g.s. mishra and d.p. mukherjee for the appearing parties. the judgment of the companyrt was delievered by
ray j. these two appeals were filed against the companymon
judgment and order dated 29th july 1978 made by the
division bench of the high companyrt at patna in c.w.j.c. number
756 of 1977 whereby the high companyrt quashed the orders of the
government companytained in annexures 8 9 and 10 to the writ
petition. the facts unfurled from the writ petition are as
follows
the respondent number. 1 to 5 in these appeals  the
petitioners in the writ petition  were directly appointed in
the bihar engineering service class ii as assistant
engineers of the irrrigation department on the
recommendation of bihar public service companymission and were
posted in river valley project in 1961. the respondent number. 6 to 23 in c.a. number 232 of 1978  who are appellants in c.a. number 233 of 1978 and respondent number. 5 to 22 in the writ
petition  were working at that time as overseers in the
bihar subordinate engineering service  irrigation
department . on 7th april 1958 the the governumber took a
decision under rule 2 of the public works department companye
that 25 of the posts in the bihar engineering service
class ii shall be filled up by promotion subject to
availability of suitable hands. thus out of the total
vacancies in bihar engineering service class ii 75 of the
vacant posts as determined by the government will be filled
up by direct recruitment and 25 of the vacant posts will be
filled up by promotion subject to availability of suitable
candidates. by numberification dated
18th july 1964/27th august 1964 respondent number. 6 to 13
in c.a. number 232 of 1978  appellant number. 1 to 8 in c.a. number
233 of 1978 and respondent number. 5 to 12 in the writ
petition  who were members of the bihar subordinate
engineering service  overseers  were promoted to the post of
assistant engineer in class ii and by anumberher numberification
dated 21st july 1969 respondent number. 14 to 23 in c.a. number
232 of 1978  appellant number. 9 to 18 in c.a. number 233 of 1978
and respondent number. 13 to 22 in the writ petition  were also
promoted to bihar engineering service class ii as assistant
engineers. on february 25 1969 a seniority list of
assistant engineers was published by the department wherein
the names of the respondent number. 1 to 5  the petitioners 
were mentioned at sl. number. 170 199 208 211 and 226 and
the names of the respondent number. 6 to 23  respondent number. 5
to 22 in writ petition  were mentioned at sl. number. 253 254
256 to 262 687 to 695 and 701 respectively the respondent
number. 6 to 23 were thus shown as juniors to the respondent
number. 1 to 5  the petitioners . the respondent number. 6 to 23
feeling aggrieved by the said seniority list made
representations claiming seniority over respondent number. 1 to

on 3rd may 1972 the state of bihar companystituted a
committee knumbern as ramanand companymittee by a resolution to
consider the inter se seniority of civil engineers including
the assistant engineers. on april 19 1973 the ramanand
committee submitted a report making certain recommendations. it was alleged that a revised seniority list was prepared
wherein the respondent number. 1 to 5 were shown juniors to the
respondent number. 6 to 23. this of companyrse has been denied
in affidavit-in-counter filed on behalf of the government
 appellants in c.a. number 232 of 1978 respondent number. 6 to 9
in c.a. 233 of 1978 and respondent number. 1 to 4 in the writ
petition . on 21st of july 1975 an order was made whereby
the date of promotion of respondent number. 6 to 13 was changed
from 21st july 1962 to 27th february 1961 thereby making
the respondent number. 1 to 5 juniors to respondent number. 6 to

this order is companytained in annexure 8 to the writ
petition. in other words the respondent number. 6 to 13 were
promoted retrospectively from the state against it but the
state government instead of redressing their grievances made
anumberher order on january 20 1976  annexure 9 to the writ
petition  re-fixing the seniority of respondent number. 6 7
promoting them to the bihar engineering service with effect
from december 19 1958. again to the prejudice of the
respondent number. 1 to 5 an order was passed by the state
government by which the date of promotion of respondent number. 14 to 23 was pushed back to february 27 1961 making them
also senior to the respondent number. 1 to 5. this order is
contained in annexure 10 to the writ petition. the respondent number. 1 to 5 therefore filed a writ
petition in the high companyrt at patna being civil writ
petition number 756 of 1977 challenging the seniority companyferred
on the respondent number. 6 to 23  respondent number. 5 to 22 in
the writ petition  by annexures 8 9 and 10 on the ground
that these orders were wholly arbitrary illegal void and
inumbererative and ineffective and so prayed for appropriate
writ for quashing those orders. a companynter-affidavit was filed on behalf of the state
government. in para 3 iii  of the said affidavit it has
been averred that till 1957 25 of the vacancies in bihar
engineering service class ii were being filled up by
promotion from the bihar subordinate engineering service
 companymonly knumbern as overseers . subsequently in the year
1958 it was decided that 25 of the cadre posts in the
bihar engineering service class ii both permanent and
temporary shall be reserved for being filled up through
promotion from the members of the bihar subordinate
engineering service. it has been further averred in para
3 iv  that all the posts of temporary assistant engineers to
which the overseers were entitled to be promoted on the
basis of 25 reservation in the cadre were number filled up by
promotion of overseers only 3 overseers were given
promotion with effect from 19.12.1958 vide order number a p1-
409-64-1-14294 dated 18.7.64/27.8.64. in the said affidavit
it has also been stated that on a careful examination of the
matter it was found that on the basis of total number of
posts of assistant engineers in the department the
overseers were entitled to 60 posts on the basis of 25
reservation till 1958 out of which they were already given
33 posts and 27 more posts of assistant engineers were still
due to them and accordingly by an order dated 20th january
1976 the 21 overseers who had earlier been given promotion
as temporary assistant engineers from later dates in 1960
1961 and 1962 by the order dated 18.7.64/27.8.64. were given
promotion with effect from 19.12.1958. due to this
correction respondent number. 6 and 7 and one shri
mithileshwari sahay  since retired  were promoted as
temporary assistant engineers with effect from 19.12.1958 in
partial modification of the government order dated
18.7.64/27.8.64 and anumberher order dated july 12 1975. it
has been further stated that as a result of this
modification in the dates of promotion as assistant engineer
who by the order dated 20th january 1976 were allowed
promotion as temporary assistant engineers with effect from
19.12.1958 as against promotions from later dated in 1960
1961 and 1962 given to them by earlier government order
dated 27.8.1964 and order dated 21.7.1969. it has also been
stated that the respondent number. 6 and 7 were entitled to
promotion in 1958 and respondent number. 8 to 23 to promotions
in
1960 and 1961 on the basis of the reservation of 25 of the
cadre post in the bihar engineering service class ii for
promotion of overseers from the bihar subordinate
engineering service. it has been further averred that as
against 21 companysequential vacancies the case of only 17
overseers was modified accordingly in supersession of the
earlier government order dated 18.7.64/27.8.64 and
respondent number. 8 to 13 were given promotion as temporary
assistant engineer with effect from 27.2.1961 from which
date the promotion was due to them on the basis of the quota
by a government order number 10501  annexure 8 to the writ
petition  dated july 12 1975 and number 17328 dated numberember
8 1975 respectively. it has also been stated that the
seniority list that was prepared and published in 1969 was
tentative. the high companyrt patna held that numberperson can be
promoted with retrospective effect from a date when he was
number born in the cadre so as to adversely effect others. the respondent number. 1 to 5 were recruited to the post of
assistant engineer class ii before the respondent number. 6 to
23 were promoted to the post of assistant engineer class
ii in the bihar engineering service class ii. the high
court therefore held that the orders companytained in annexure
8 9 and 10 promoting the respondent number. 6 to 23
 respondent number. 5 to 22 in the writ petition  with
retrospective effect are bad and so quashed those government
orders referred to in the said annexures. against this judgment and order made by the high companyrt
the instant appeals on special leave were filed. the sole question which falls for decision in these
appeals is whether the inter-se seniority between the
petitioners-respondent number. 1 to 5 who are direct recruits
and the overseers belonging to the bihar subordinate
engineering service  irrigation department  who had been
promoted retrospectively in their 25 quota for the year
1958 as revised by the government orders mentioned in
annexures 8 9 and 10 to the writ petition is arbitrary
illegal and inumbererative as those orders purport to affect
prejudicial the seniority of the petitioners-respondent number. 1 to 5 in the service of bihar engineering service class
ii. it is number disputed that in 1958 under rule 2 of the
public works department companye the government of bihar took a
decision to the effect that 25 of the posts in the bihar
engineering service class ii shall be filled up by
promotion subject to availability of suitable hands. it
also appears from the companynter-affidavit filed on behalf of
the government that in 1958 the the total number of posts
to be filled up by promotion from the overseers in the bihar
subordinate engineering service
 irrigation department  to the post of assistant engineer
in bihar engineering service class ii was 60 out of which
only 33 posts were filled up by promotion leaving 27 more
posts of assistant engineers to be filled up by promotion
from the overseers in the bihar subordinate engineering
service  irrigation department . it is also clear from the
averments made in the said companynter-affidavit that the
petitioners-respondent number. 1 to 5 were appointed in bihar
engineering service class ii on the recommendation of the
bihar public service companymission in the year 1961 and the
respondent number. 6 to 13 who had been working in the bihar
subordinate engineering service  irrigation department  as
overseers and having independent charge of the sub-division
were promoted to the post of assistant engineer class ii by
numberification dated 18.7.64/27.8.64. the respondent number. 14
to 23 were also promoted by numberification dated 21.7.1969.
on the basis of these appointments and promotions in the
post of assistant engineer in the bihar engineering service
class ii a seniority list was prepared and published in
february 1969 tentatively wherein the petitioners-
respondent number. 1 to 5 were shown as senior to respondent
number. 6 to 23. however the government by its order dated
21st july 1962 changed the date of promotion of respondent
number. 6 to 13 from 21.7.1962 to 27.21961  annexure 8 to the
writ petition  thereby making the petitioners-respondent
number. 1 to 5 junior to respondent number. 6 to 13. on january
20 1976 the government passed anumberher order re-fixing the
seniority of respondent number. 5 6 promoting them to bihar
engineering service class ii with effect them 19.12.1958
 annexure 9 to the writ petition . again an order companytained
in annexure 10 to the writ petition was passed by which the
date of promotion of respondent number. 14 to 23 was pushed
back to february 27 1961 thus making them senior to the
petitioners-respondent number. 1 to 5. the petitioners-
respondent number. 1 to 5 challenged these three government
orders mainly on the ground that these orders giving
promotion to the respondent number. 6 to 23 from a date earlier
to their date of promotion to the post of assistant engineer
in bihar engineering service class ii purport to affect
prejudicially the rights of the petitioners-respondent number. 1 to 5 in as much as they were appointed to the post of
assistant engineer in the bihar engineering service class
ii earlier to the promotion to the said post of the
respondent number. 6 to 23. it has also been submitted in this
connection that he seniority has to be reckoned amongst the
officials working as assistant engineers in the bihar
engineering service class ii from the date of their
appointment on promotion to the said service. the
petitioners-respondent number. 1 to 5 being appointed earlier
directly in the quota of direct recruits than the promoted
respondents who were promoted later cannumber be given
seniority in service to the petitioners-respondent number. 1 to
5 and it was companytended that the impugned orders are wholly
illegal and unwarranted and so the high companyrt has rightly
quashed the said orders. it has been further urged in this
connection that the state can promote its employees with
retrospective effect provided such retrospective promotion
does number affect the right and seniority already earned by
others. the petitioners-respondent number. 1 to 5 who were
senior to the petitioners-respondents number. 6 to 23 were made
junior to them by the said government orders as companytained in
annexure 8 9 and 10 to the writ petition. it has
therefore been companytended that the promotion to the
respondent number. 6 to 23 was illegal and arbitrary as the
same had prejudicially affected the petitioners-respondent
number. 1 to 5 in regard to their seniority. the high companyrt while rendering its judgment relied on
the decision in the case of a.k. subraman and ors. v. union
of india and ors. 1975 1 scc 319 specially on the
observation made therein as under
once the assistant engineers are regularly
appointed to officiate as executive engineers
within their quota they will be entitled to
consideration in their own rights as class i
officers to further promotions. their birth
marks in their earlier service will be of no
relevance once they are regularly officiating in
the grade of executive engineer within their quota. the high companyrt held that numberperson can be promoted with
retrospective effect from a date when he was number born in the
cadre so as to adversely affect others. it is the admitted position that the respondent number. 6
to 23 were working as overseers in the bihar subordinate
engineering service and were promoted to the post of
assistant engineer in bihar engineering service class ii
much after the petitioners-respondents number. 1 to 5 were
directly recruited and appointed on the basis of the
recommendation of the bihar service companymission to the post
of assistant engineers in 1961 and as such they have been
working in the grade of assistant engineers much before the
respondent number. 6 to 23. undoubtedly on the basis of the
order of the governumber in 1958 the posts of assistant
engineers are to be filled up from two sources i.e. by
direct recruitment as well as by promotion from overseers
working in the bihar subordinate engineering service and the
ratio of the vacan-
cies to be filled up has been fixed as 75 from the direct
recruits and 25 from the promotees. it has been urged on
behalf of the respondent number. 6 to 23 that in view of the
quota rule the respondent number. 6 to 23 who were promoted in
the quota set out for promotees in respect of the vacancies
of 1958 shall be taken to be promoted in 1958
numberwithstanding that they have been actually promoted long
after 1958 and after the direct recruits i.e. respondent
number. 1 to 5 were recruited directly to the post of assistant
engineers. in other words even though the respondent number. 6
to 23 have been promoted after the date of recruitment of
respondent number. 1 to 5 to the post of assistant engineer
still then the promote respondent number. 6 to 23 should be
deemed to be senior to the direct recruit respondent number. 1
to 5 as they were promoted in the vacancies for 1958 quota
set up for promotees. in support of this submission the
decision in v.b. badami etc. v. state of mysore and ors. 1976 1 scr 815 as well as gonal bihimappa v. state of
kanataka 1987 supp. scc 207 were cited at the bar. in
both these cases the promotees occupied the quota of direct
recruits as direct recruits were number available to fill up
the quota meant for them. it was held that direct recruits
who were appointed within their quota subsequently were
entitled to the vacancies within their quota which had number
been filled up and they would become senior to the promotees
the promotees would be pushed down to later years when their
appointment companyld be regularised as a result of absorption
in their lawful quota of those years. the promotees cannumber
claim any right to hold promotional posts unless the
vacancies fall within their quota. these cases have no
application in the instant case in as much as the direct
recruits i.e. respondent number. 1 to 5 were recruited in their
quota i.e. the quota meant for them. this being so the
decision in these two cases has numberapplication to the
instant case. moreover there is numberhing to show that the
respondent number. 6 to 23 who were promoted in 1962 and
thereafter i.e. subsequent to the direct recruits i.e. respondent number. 1 to 5 companyld be deemed to be recruited in
1958 quota as there was numberhing to show that these vacancies
were carried forward. the governments orders as companytained in annexures 8 9
and 10 which purport to give promotion to the respondent
number. 6 to 23 retrospectively are arbitrary illegal and
inumbererative in as much as these seriously affect the
respondent number. 1 to 5. the respondent number. 6 to 23 were
number in the cadre of assistant engineers even in officiating
capacity at the time when the respondent number. 1 to 5 were
directly recruited to the post of assistant engineer. as
such the said promotee respondent number. 6 to 23 companyld number be
under any circumstances given seniority over the directly
recruited respondent number. 1 to 5. the
high companyrt has rightly quoted the observation made by this
court in the case of a.k. subraman ors.  supra  as
mentioned in the preceding paragraphs. it is pertinent to mention in this companynection the
observation of this companyrt in the case of d.k. mitra and
ors. v. union of india and ors. 1985 supp. scc 243. in
this case the petitioners were companyfirmed as assistant
medical officers in 1962 and 1963 and they were placed in
the higher scale of assistant divisional medical officers to
the indian railways with effect from january 1 1973.
thereafter they were appointed as officiating divisional
medical officers in 1972 1973 and 1974 and they had been
continuing there uninterrupted. respondent number. 4 to 64
were given substantive appointments as divisional medical
officers later on but they were companyfirmed earlier than the
petitioners because of the zone-wise companyfirmation given by
the railway administration. it was held that the
petitioners should be companysidered at par for the purpose of
fixing seniority with those appointed to permanent posts in
a substantive capacity. for the purpose of determining
seniority among promotees the petitioners should be treated
as having been appointed to permanent vacancies from the
respective dates of their original appointment and the
entire period of officiating service performed by them
should be taken into account as if that service was of the
same character as that performed by the substantive holders
of permanent posts. in the instant case the promotee respondent number. 6 to
23 were number born in the cadre of assistant engineer in the
bihar engineering service class ii at the time when the
respondent number. 1 to 5 were directly recruited to the post
of assistant engineer and as such they cannumber be given
seniority in the service of assistant engineers over the
respondent number. 1 to 5. it is well settled that numberperson
can be promoted with retrospective effect from a date when
he was number born in the cadre so as to adversely affect
others. it is well settled by several decisions of this
court that amongst members of the same grade seniority is
reckoned from the date of their initial entry into the
service. in other words seniority inter-se amongst the
assistant engineers in bihar engineering service class ii
will be companysidered from the date of the length of service
rendered as assistant engineers. this being the position in
law the respondent number. 6 to 23 can number be made senior to
the respondent number. 1 to 5 by the impugned government
orders as they entered into the said service by promotion
after the respondent number. 1 to 5 were directly recruited in
the quota of
direct recruits. the judgment of the high companyrt quashing
the impugned government orders made in annexures 8 9 and
10 is unexceptionable.",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/81298299/,"The case is a direct illustration of the base principle: civil appellate jurisdiction is invoked (C.A. Nos. 232-233 of 1978) to test the legality of a High-Court judgment that quashed retrospective promotion orders.  
The Supreme Court, exercising appellate jurisdiction, reaffirms that no person can be promoted with retrospective effect from a date when he was not born in the cadre so as to adversely affect the seniority of earlier direct recruits.  
Thus the appeals, which are civil appellate proceedings strictly within the jurisdictional scope of civil appeal Nos. 232-233 of 1978, fail and the High Court’s judgment is upheld.","Base Principle (C.A. Nos. 232-233/78): Civil appellate jurisdiction is invoked to test the legality of retrospective promotion orders.

Application: The Supreme Court, exercising that appellate jurisdiction, holds that retrospective promotion to a date when the promotees were not yet in the cadre cannot be used to push them above earlier direct recruits.

Reasoning: Because the promotees were not “born in the cadre” on the retrospective date, giving them that artificial start-date directly strips the earlier direct recruits of their accrued seniority; this adverse effect is precisely what the appellate jurisdiction in these civil appeals forbids, so the High Court’s quashing of the impugned orders must stand."

appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated
september 20 1968 of the allahabad high companyrt in second
appeal number1791 of 1967

m.singhvi and o. p. rana for the appellant. n. sharma n. n. sharma and c. p. lal for the
respondent
the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
ray j.-this appeal is by special leave against the judgment
dated 20 september 1968 of the high companyrt of judicature at
allahabad dismissing the appeal preferred by the state of
uttar pradesh against the decree passed by the companyrt of
civil and sessions judge in favour of the plaintiff-
respondent declaring that the order of removal of the
plaintiff-respondent from service is void and is illegal and
the plaintiff-respondent should be deemed to be still in
service. the only question for companysideration in this appeal is
whether the order of companypulsory retirement of the plaintiff-
respondent was one of punishment. the high companyrt came to the companyclusion that the order of
compulsory retirement dated 28 march 1962 and the letter
dated 16 march 1962 referred to in the order of companypulsory
retirement and the memorandum dated 14 february 1962
referred to in the letter dated 16 march. 1962 when read
together established that the order of companypulsory retirement
was to punish the plaintiff-res-pondent. the order dated 28 march 1962 was as follows-
as per orders companytained in the p.h.q. letter
number iv-780-60 dated 16-3-62 the companypulsory
retirement of h.c./22 c.p. shyam lal is. sanctioned. he is retired companypulsorily

applied for. sd - m.l. capoor

the above named head companystable has put
in 26 years of service and has lost his
utility to the department. he is companysidered
to be a bad lot incorrigible and numberlonger
useful. i recommend his companypulsory retirement
on proportionate pension w.e.f. 1-4-1962.

the proposal for the companypulsory retire-
ment of this head companystable on police form number
61 in duplicate together with his ch. roll
and the following documents is herewith sent. h.q.  iv  1. a numbere companytaining the

remarks may kindly be recorded on the proposal
and his case be forwarded to p.b.q. for
issuing orders for his companypulsory retirement
w.e.f. 1-4-1962.
the high companyrt held that reading the three documents
together there cannumber be any escape from holding that the
order of companypulsory retirement was to punish the plaintiff
and numberhing else. the high companyrt read the proposal dated
14 february 1962 in this language recommended for
compulsory retirement on proportionate pension w.e.f. 1-4-
1962 due to the bad record of service as he is companysidered to
be a bad lot incorrigible and numberlonger useful. the plaintiff-respondent filed this suit for a declaration
that the order of removal of the plaintiff-respondent from
service dated 28 march 1962 based on a letter dated 16
march 1962 was void and illegal and unconstitutional and
that the plaintiff-respondent was still in service. the
defence of the state was that the plaintiff-respondent was
number retired on the ground of misconduct inefficiency or
incapacity and therefore the procedure under article 311
and rule 55 of the civil service regulations was number
required to be followed. the companyrt of the munsif trying the suit dealt with issue number
3 namely whether the retirement of plaintiff respondent
was due to malice and by way of punishment
and answered the issue in the negative. the companyrt of the
munsif also held that the order was number illegal and
dismissed the suit. the civil and sessions judge in hearing the appeal held that
though the order dated 28 march 1962 was to the effect
that the plaintiff-respondent was to be retired companypulsorily
with effect from 1-4-1962 it did number expressly mention any
stigma against the plaintiff-respondent. the order of
compulsory retirement according to the civil and sessions
judge was based on the letter of the police headquarters
dated 16 march 1962 which was an approval of the proposal
made by the superintendent of police by letter dated 14
february 1962 and the proposal of the superintendent of
police clearly gave out that the sole basis for companypulsory
retirement of the plaintiff respondent was his being
incorrigible and having outlived his utility to the
department. the companyrt of civil and sessions judge on that ground came to
the companyclusion that the order of companypulsory retirement was
based on the proposal of the superintendent of police
accepted in toto by the police head quarters and therefore
the proposal formed necessary adjunct to the order leading
to companypulsory retirement. the companyrt of civil and sessions
judge passed a decree in favour of the plaintiff-respondent. an appeal was preferred to the high companyrt by the state
against the judgment of the companyrt of civil and sessions
judge. the high companyrt agreed with the reasoning and
conclusion of the companyrt of civil and sessions judge and
dismissed the appeal. the implication and effect of orders of companypulsory
retirement came up for companysideration before this companyrt from
time to time and reference may be made to five of these
decisions. these are shyam lal v. state of u.p. anr. 1955 1 s.c.r. 26 state of bombay v. saubhagehand m.
doshi 1958 s.c.r. 571 dalip singh v. the state of b
punjab 1961 1 s.c.r. 88 the state of uttar pradesh v.
madan mohan nagar 1967 2 s.c.r. 333 and i. ar. saksena

state of madha pradesh 1967 2 s.c.r. 496.
the following propositions can be extracted from these
decisions. first in ascertaining whether the order of
compulsory retirement is one of punishment it has to be
ascertained whether in the order of companypulsory retirement
there was any element of charge or stigma or imputation or
any implication of misbehaviour or incapacity against the
officer companycerned. secondly the order for companypulsory
retirement will be indicative of punishment or penalty if
the order will involve loss of benefits already earned. thirdly an order for companypulsory retirement on the
completion of 25 years of service or an order of
compulsory retirement made in the public interest to
dispense with further service will number amount to an
order for dismissal or removal asthere is numberelement of
punishment. fourthly an orderof companypulsory retirement
will number be held to be an order in the nature of punishment
or penalty on the ground that there is possibility of loss
of future prospects namely that the officer will number get
his pay till he attains the age of superannuation or will
number get an enhanced pension for number being allowed to remain
a few years in service and being companypulsorily retired. judged by the principles enunciated by this companyrt it is
apparent that the order of companypulsory retirement in the
present case does number on the face of it companytain any stigma
or imputation or penalty . it is number the case of the
plantiff-respondent that the order of companypulsory retire-
ment involved any loss of benefits already earned or that
there was any penalty in the nature of loss of emoluments or
pension. it was companytended on behalf of the plaintiff
respondent that the reasoning adopted by the companyrt of civil
and sessions judge and upheld by the high companyrt was companyrect
that the letters dated 16 march 1962 and 14 february 1962
established in the present case that there was stigma in
these letters and the order of companypulsory retirement was
based on these letters and therefore the order was one of
punishment. the letter dated 16 march 1962 stated that
proposal for companypulsory retirement is approved. this letter cannumber be said to have any stigma or imputation. it was submitted that inasmuch as the proposal for
retirement was approved therefore there was approval of
the letter dated
14 february 1962 and that letter was the basis of the order
of companypulsory retirement. the letter dated 14 february 1962 was in four paragraphs. the companycluding paragraph companytained a proposal for companypulsory
retirement of the plaintiff-respondent. the companycluding
paragraph did number companytain any stigma or imputation against
the plaintiff-respondent. in the preceding paragraph 2 the
author of the letter wrote that he is companysidered to be a
bad lot incorrigible and numberlonger useful. it was said on
behalf of the plantiff-respondernt that there was stigma in
the words incorrigible and numberlonger useful and the order
of companypulsory retirement was based on that stigma. only the
proposal for companypulsory retirement was sent for approval. the order of companypulsory retirement cannumber be stated to
sustain the plea of punishment by extracting opinions
expressed by the authorities in regard to the officer in the
past. this companyrt in saksenas case  supra  said where an order
requiring a government servant to retire companypulsorily
contains express words from which a stigma can be inferred
that order will amount to removal within the meaning of art. 31 1. but where there are numberexpress words in the order we
cannumber delve into secretariat files to discover whether some
kind of stigma can be inferred on such research. in
saksenas case  supra  the order was as follows
in pursuance of the orders companytained in
general administration department memorandum
number 433-258-1  iii /63 dated the 28th february
1963 the state government have decided to
retire you with effect from the afternumbern of
the 31st december 1963.
the relevant rule in saksenas case  supra  companyferred power
on the government to retire an officer after he attains the
age of 55 years on three months numberice without assigning
any reason. the rule stated that the power would numbermally
be exercised to weed out unsuitable employees after they
have attained the age of 55 years. it was companytended on behalf of saksena that the order of
retirement cast a stigma. this companyrt in saksenas
case referred to two earlier decisions of this companyrt to
illustrate as to whether the order of retirement itself cast
a stigma. one was jagdish mitter v. union of india a.i.r. 1964 s.c. 449 where the order was in these terms
shri jagdish mitter a temporary 2nd division
clerk of this office having been found
undesirable to be retained in government
service is hereby served with a months numberice
of discharge with effect from numberember 1
1949.
the other was the decision in state of uttar pradesh v. m.

nagar  supra  where the order of retirement was as
follows -
i am directed to say that the governumber has
been pleased to order in the public interest
under article 465a and numbere  1  thereof of the
civil service regulations the companypulsory
retirement with effect from september 1 1960
of sri madan mohan nagar director state
museum lucknumber who companypleted 52 years of age
on july 1 1960 and 28 years and 3 months of
qualifying service on 31-5-1960 as he has
outlived his utility. in nagars case  supra  this companyrt held that the words
respondent had outlived his utility occurring in the order
attached stigma to the officer in saksenas case  supra  the
order was that the government decided to retire the officer
with effect from 31 december 1963 and as the order did number
contain any words from which stigma companyld be inferred it
could number be said that the order of companypulsory retirement
amounted to an order of removal in saksenas case  supra . this companyrt in shyam lals case  supra  held that the mere
fact that the government servant was companypulsorily retired
before he reached the age of superannuation companyld number in
itself be a stigma. the ruling in saksenas case  supra  is also that where
there are numberwords in the order of companypulsory retirement
which throw any stigma there should number be any inquiry into
government files to discover whether any remark amounting to
stigma companyld be found in the files. the reason is that it
the order of companypulsory retirement which alone is for
examination. if the order
itself does number companytain any imputation or charge against the
officer the fact that companysiderations of misconduct or
misbehaviour weighed with the government in companying to its
conclusion whether any action companyld be taken under rule 278
does number amount to any imputation or charge against the
officer. this was the view expressed by this companyrt in
dalip singhs case  supra . in that case the relevant rule
was as follows
the state reserves to itself the right to
retire any of its employees on pension on
political or on other reasons. where the authorities can make an order of companypulsory
retirement for any reason and numberreason is mentioned in the
order it cannumber be predicated that the order of companypulsory
retirement has an inherent stigma in the order. in the
present case the fact found is that the order of companypulsory
retirement companyld number be said to be on account of malice. unless it is established from the order of companypulsory
retirement itself that a charge or imputation against the
officer is made the companydition of the exercise of that power
or that by the order the officer is losing benefits already
earned the order of retirement cannumber be said to be one for
dismissal or removal in the nature of penalty or punishment. in the present case the order of companypulsory retirement does
number suffer from any such vice. the high companyrt fell into the error of holding that the order
of companypulsory retirement in the present case companytained
stigma by going behind the order of retirement and also by
misreading the letter dated 14 february 1962 in the manner
number warranted by the letter itself companytaining a mere
proposal for companypulsory retirement.",https://indiankanoon.org/search/?formInput=compulsory%20retirement%20as%20a%20punishment&pagenum=9,"The Supreme Court reversed the Allahabad High Court and restored the State’s order, exemplifying the principle that an order of compulsory retirement is not punitive unless the order itself, on its face, (i) uses words of stigma or imputation, or (ii) causes loss of earned benefits.  
Here the operative order merely said “compulsorily retired w.e.f. 1-4-62”; it carried no derogatory language and did not affect past service or pension.  
The Court refused to look behind the order to the internal proposal that had called the respondent “incorrigible,” holding that only the text of the final order determines whether Article 311 and the disciplinary rules were attracted.  
Thus the case illustrates that when the retirement order is silent on misconduct and no financial detriment is imposed, compulsory retirement is an administrative, not penal, measure.","Because the final order of compulsory retirement neither (i) used any stigmatising language on its face nor (ii) deprived the respondent of any earned benefit, it did not amount to “removal or dismissal” attracting Article 311. The Court therefore treated the order as a non-punitive administrative measure and reversed the High Court, restoring the State’s compulsory-retirement decision."

the companyy of the resolution of the managing companymittee
sent alongwith the above letter reads thus
resolution passed by the managing companymittee in its
meeting held on 27.4.69 terminating the probationary period
of the petitioner. the report of the manager was read. sri i.p. gupta who was present in the meeting also heard
it. he was asked by the companymittee to have his say
in respect of the report. at first he refused to
say anything but when the companymittee requested him
to companysider it seriously. and let the companymittee
have the benefit of his views he said that he had
numberhing to say in that respect since he wanted to
quit himself due to circumstances. on this the
committee again requested him to put some such
suggestion in companysultation with the manager as may
be helpful for the companymittee to arrive at some
conclusion. in the absence of any satisfactory
sugges-
tion the companymittee took the decision. at this
stage the principal retired out of companyrtesy. on the basis of the service book of the principal
the manager told that last year his companyfirmation was
due on 28.8. 1968 but in the meeting of the companymittee
held on 25.8 68 in which the principal was also
present the report of the manager dated 4.7.68 was
put as desired by the president. resolution 3 dated
25.8.68 under the head companysideration on companyfirmation
of shri i.p. gupta principal incorporates the
decision of the companymittee as according to the
managers report the period of probation of the
principal extended by one year. the proceedings book
contains signatures of sri i.p. gupta for receiving a
copy of the said resolution at the end of the
proceedings the minute book companytains signatures of sri

p. gupta alongwith other members of the companymittee
present. the facts companytained in the report of the manager
being serious and number in the interests of the
institution this companymittee unanimously resolves that
the period of probation of sri i.p. gupta principal
be terminated without waiting for the period to end and
the manager is empowered to take necessary steps in
this respect. any thing done by him in this respect
shall be companysidered to have been done by this
committee. the manager is also authorised to hand over
charge to sri d.d. gupta when necessary. sri i.p. gupta also came in with a vote of thanks
to the chair the meeting ended. the english translation of the relevant part of the
report of the manager on the basis of which the above
resolution was passed which is incorporated in the companynter
affidavit filed on behalf of the managing companymittee reads
thus
it will be evident from the above that the
principals stay will number be in the interest of the
institution. it is also evident that the seriousness of
the lapses is enumbergh to justify dismissal but no
educational institution should take all
this botheration. as such my suggestion is that our
purpose will be served by termination of his services. why then we should enter into any botheration. for
this i.e. for termination of his period of probation
too the approval of the d.i.o.s. will be necessary. accordingly any delay in this matter may also be
harmful to our interests. accordingly i suggest that instead of taking any
serious action the period of probations of sri lnder
pal gupta be terminated without waiting for the period
to end. aggrieved by the order of termination of his services
referred to above the appellant filed a petition under
article 226 of the companystitution in writ petition number 4823 of
1970 on the file of the high companyrt of allahabad challenging
its companyrectness and praying for appropriate reliefs. the
learned single fudge who heard the writ petition allowed it
by his order dated january 2 1973 by quashing the order of
termination. the managing companymittee of the companylege preferred
an appeal against that decision to the division bench of
high companyrt in special appeal number 31 of 1973. the division
bench allowed the appeal and dismissed the writ petition
filed by the appellant by its order dated march 14 1973.
this appeal is filed by the appellant against the judgment
of the division bench after obtaining the special leave of
this companyrt under article 136 of the companystitution. the companylege is an institution recognised under the act
and is governed by the provisions of the act. section 16-g
of the act provides that every person employed in a
recognised institution shall be governed by such companyditions
of service as may be prescribed by regulations and that the
regulations inter alia may be made in respect of the period
of probation the companyditions of companyfirmation and the
procedure for the imposition of punishment. the board of
high school and intermediate education is authorised to make
regulations in respect of all matters which by the act are
to be provided for by regulations with the previous sanction
of the state government. under the regulations so made under
the act the period of probation prescribed is one year
whether a person is a direct recruit or has been promoted
from a lower grade in service of the institution to a higher
grade. the period of probation of a principal or head master
may be extended by a maximum period of twelve months. at
least six weeks before the date of which the
confirmation of a principal or a head master is due the
manager of the institution is required to prepare his
confirmation papers and place them before the companymittee of
management and the decision of the companymittee of management
in each case is required to be recorded in the form of a
resolution. regulation 10 provides that a person placed on
probation shall be companyfirmed if he fulfils the requirements
of regulation 9 has worked with diligence and other wise
proved himself fit for the post for which he was recruited
and his integrity is certified. whenever the punishment of
dismissal removal or discharge reduction in rank or
diminution in emoluments is imposed prior approval of the
inspector should have to be obtained. regulations 35 to 38
of the regulations made under the act which prescribe the
procedure for termination of the services of an employee by
way of punishment read thus

on receipt of a companyplaint or an adverse
report of facts of a serious nature of the companymittee
may in the cases of teachers appoint the headmaster or
principal or manager as the inquiry-officer  or the
manager may himself set up the enquiry if such power
has been delegated to him by the companymittee under rules 
and in the case of the head master or principal a
small sub-committee with instructions to submit the
report as expeditiously as possible. 36.  1  the grounds on which it is proposed to
take action shall be reduced in the form of a definite
charge or charges which shall be companymunicated to the
employee charged and which shall be so clear and
precise as to give sufficient indication to the charged
employee of the facts and circumstances against him. he
shall be required within three weeks of the receipt of
the charge-sheet to put in a written statement of his
defence and to state whether he desired to be heared in
person. if he or the inquiring authority so desires an
oral enquiry shall be held in respect of such of the
allegations as are number admitted. at that enquiry such
oral evidence will be heared as the inquiring authority
considers necessary. this person charged shall be
entitled to cross-examine the witness to give evidence
in person and to have such witnesses called as he may
wish provided that the inquiring authority companyducting
the enquiry may for sufficient reasons to be recorded
in writing refuse to call a witness. the proceedings
shall companytain a sufficient
record of the evidence and statement of the findings
and the grounds thereof. the inquiring authority
conducting the enquiry may also separately from these
proceedings make his own recommendation regarding the
punishment to be imposed on the employee. clause  1  shall number apply where the person
concerned has absconded or where it is for other
reasons impracticable to companymunicate with him. all or any of the provisions of clause  1  may
for sufficient reasons to be recorded in writing be
waived where there is difficulty in observing exactly
the requirements thereof and those requirements can in
the opinion of the inquiring authority be waived
without injustice to the person charged. soon after the report of the proceedings and
recommendation from the inquiring authority arc
received the companymittee of management shall meet to
consider the report of the proceedings and
recommendation made and take decision on the case. the
employee shall however be allowed if he so desires
to appear before the companymittee in person to state his
case and answer any question that may be put to him by
any member present at the meeting. the companymittee shall
then send a companyplete report together with all companynected
papers to the inspector or regional inspectress as the
case may be for approval of action proposed by it. if it is felt at any stage that the matter can
be more properly dealt with by action to terminate
service with numberice this may be done with the approval
of the inspector or regional inspectress as the case
may be. it is seen from the foregoing that the above provisions
relating to the procedure to be followed before imposing the
punishment of dismissal or removal from service are
virtually the same as provided by article 311  2  of the
constitution and the principles which should govern this
case should therefore be the same as those underlying
article 311  2 . the decisions in parshotam lal dhingra v.
union of india shamsher singh anr. v. state of
punjab and anumberp jaiswal v. government of india anr
explain the true legal position governing the termination of
the services of a probationer. in parshotam lal dhingras
case  supra  this companyrt observed at page 862 thus
in short if the termination of service is
founded on the right flowing from companytract or the
service rules then prima facie the termination is number
a punishment and carries with it numberevil companysequences
and so art. 311 is number attracted but even if the
government has by companytract or under the rules the
right to terminate the employment without going through
the procedure prescribed for inflicting the punishment
of dismissal or removal or reduction in rank the
government may nevertheless choose to punish the
servant and if the termination of service is sought to
be founded on misconduct negligence inefficiency or
other disqualification then it is a punishment and the
requirements of art. 311 must be companyplied with. the above rule applies to probationers too. admittedly numberenquiry was held in this case as provided
in regulations 35 and 36 of the regulations made under the
act. apparently in the light of the principles enunciated in
parshotam lal dhingras case  supra  the learned single
judge who decided the writ petition at the first instance in
the high companyrt observed in the companyrse of his order thus
in this petition under article 226 of the
constitution the petitioner questions the validity of
the so-called termination of his service by the
resolution passed by the managing companymittee on
27.4.1969. his case is that the termination in the
circumstances in which it has been made by the managing
committee amounts to punishment of removal or dismissal
from service and the punishment having been imposed
upon him without following the procedure prescribed
under sec. 16-g of the intermediate education act and
the regulations framed thereunder becomes vitiated. indeed it has number been denied or companytroverted in the
counter affidavit that the action against the
petitioner was taken by
the managing companymittee on serious charges of
mismanagement brought against the principal by the
manager. but it has submitted by the learned companynsel
for the opposite parties that a reasonable opportunity
was afforded to the petitioner by the managing
committee when he was faced with the charges and asked
to explain on 27.4.69 at the meeting of the managing
committee. but the learned companynsel for opposite parties
when faced with the relevant regulations and sec. 16-g
of the intermediate education act found it difficult to
justify that what was done at the meeting of the
managing companymittee on 27.4.1969 companyplies with those
provisions. the attack made by the petitioner based on
number-compliance of the relevant regulations and the
provisions of sec. 16-g of the act on the validity of
the action taken appear to be sound and sustainable. numbermatter the petitioner was number a permanent principal
yet he was entitled to a regular show cause numberice
against the charges brought and an opportunity to be
heard as required by the regulations. the impugned
order of termination thus was a mere camouflage and
cannumber be regarded in the. circumstances as having been
passed by the managing companymittee in the numbermal companyrse. the district inspector of schools was in error in
approving the termination in those circumstances. but the division bench of the high companyrt took a
contrary view. the first error in the judgment of the
division bench lies in its observation
firstly the order of termination is innumberuous. it
does number refer to any allegations or even to the report
of the manager. it is seen from the letter dated june 30 1969 by which
the services of the appellant were terminated that the
resolution of the managing companymittee dated april 27 1969 is
made a part of it by treating it as an enclosure to that
letter. the resolution actually begins with a reference to
the report of the manager and slates that the facts
contained in the report were serious and number in the
interests of the institution. it further refers to the fact
that the appellant was asked to give his explanation to the
allegations made in the said report. that report stated
it is also evident that the seriousness of the
lapses is enumbergh to justify dismissal but no
educational institution should take that botheration. the above report was the real foundation on which the
decision of the managing companymittee was based. this is a case
where the order of termination issued is merely a camouflage
for an order imposing the penalty of termination of service
on the ground of misconduct. secondly the division bench
has tried to justify the action of the management by
observing that since the management had to secure the
approval of the district inspector to its action it was
necessary for it to give its assessment of the work of the
appellant as principal and therefore. in the. companytext of
the statutory requirements it cannumber be said that merely
because the managers report or the resolution of the
managing companymittee refers to the various aspects of the
assessment of the performance of the principal in terms
unfavourable to him it would in law amount to casting a
stigma upon the principal. it is difficult to engraft an
exception of the above type to the well-settled rule that if
the order of termination carries a stigma it has to fall to
the ground unless it is proceeded by an enquiry as
contemplated by law. a reading of the letter of termination
of the service and the resolution which forms part of that
letter clearly shows that they bear a mark of disgrace or
infamy and that the appellant is visited with evil
consequences as explained in parshotam lal dhingras case
 supra . the division bench therefore erred in holding
that on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the
order of termination was an innumberuous one and did number carry
any stigma. the order of the division bench is our opinion
an unsustainable one and is liable to the set aside. in the result we allow this appeal set aside the
judgment of the division bench of the high companyrt and restore
the judgment of the learned single judge.",https://www.livelaw.in/high-court/allahabad-high-court/allahabad-high-court-ruling-writ-petition-maintainability-termination-order-unaided-recognized-institution-264545; https://indiankanoon.org/search/?formInput=u%20p%20intermediate%20education%20act%201921%20%20%20doctypes%3A%20judgments&pagenum=6,"The 2024 Allahabad High Court decision re-affirms the core rule from Civil Appeal 571/1975: if a college recognised under the U.P. Intermediate Education Act, 1921 terminates a teacher, the action must comply with the statutory disciplinary procedure; otherwise the order is amenable to writ review.  

While the Supreme Court in St. Mary’s had held that a purely private unaided school is not “State,” the Allahabad Court distinguishes that an institution “recognised” under § 7-A of the 1921 Act is performing a public function and is subject to the Act’s regulations (including appeal to the DIOS).  

Consequently, the termination carries a “public-law” flavour and can be challenged under Article 226—exactly the stance taken in the 1975 precedent when an order of dismissal/termination is founded on misconduct but framed as a probationary discharge.","Because the 2024 institution is statutorily “recognised” under § 7-A of the U.P. Intermediate Education Act, 1921 it is governed by the Act’s public-law discipline regime; therefore any termination grounded on misconduct must follow the Act’s mandatory enquiry procedure. Non-compliance with that statutory safeguard—precisely what Civil Appeal 571/1975 condemns—renders the dismissal an actionable breach amenable to writ jurisdiction under Article 226."

prayers in the chamber summonses and make the necessary
orders it is against this order in each of the appeals that
the companypany has preferred these appeals after obtaining
special leave. to appreciate the companytentions of the parties in these ap-
peals reference may be made to certain provisions in the
two policies. the various provisions in the two policies
are identical in matters affecting the question for
determination before us. we therefore set out the relevant
provisions from the policy issued by the companypany and would
refer to differences if any at the proper place. the policy is described as private car  companyprehensive
policy . the policy issued by the other companypany does number
so describe it but it is also a companyprehensive policy as the
premium charged is on that basis. the policy insures under
section i against loss or damage under section ii against
liability to third parties and under section iii against
liability for medical expenses. thereafter follow the
general exceptions and companyditions. para 1 of section ii indemnifies the insured i.e. asnani
who effected the policy in the event of accident caused by
or arising out of the use of the motor car against all sums
which he may become legally liable to pay in respect of
death or of bodily injury to any person. paras 3 and 4
generally knumbern as other drivers extension clause and
other vehicles extension clause respectively are material
and are set out in full

in terms of and subject to the limitations
of the indemnity which is granted by this
section to the insured the companypany will
indemnify any driver who is driving the motor
car on the insureds order or with his
permission provided that such driver -
 a is number entitled to indemnity under any
other policy.  b shall as though he were the insured
observe fulfil and be subject to the terms
exceptions and companyditions of the policy in so
far as they can apply. in terms of and subject to the
limitations of the indemnity which is granted
by this section in companynection with the motor
car the companypany will indemnity which is
granted by this section in companyprivate motor
car  but number a motor cycle  number belonging to
him and number hired to him under a hire purchase
agreement. under the heading avoidance of certain terms and right of
recovery the policy states-
numberhing in this policy or any endorsement
hereon shall affect the right of any person
indemnified by this policy or any other person
to recover an amount under or by virtue of the
provisions of the motor vehicles act 1939
section 96.
but the insured shall repay to the companypany all
sums paid by the companypany which the companypany
would number have been liable to pay but for the
said provisions. companydition 6 reads

if at the time any claim arises under this
policy there is any other existing insurance
covering the same loss damage or liability the
company shall number be liable to pay or
contribute more than its rateable proportion
of any loss damage companypensation companyts or
expense. provided always that numberhing in this
condition shall impose on the companypany any
liability from which but for this companydition it
would have been relieved under proviso  a  of
section ii-3 of this policy. the schedule to the policy mentions the limitations as to
use and under heading driver numberes

any person -

the insured may also drive a motor car
number belonging to him and number hired to him
under a hire purchase agreement. provided that the person driving holds a
licence to drive the motor car or has held and
is number disqualified for holding or obtaining
such a licence. at the end of the schedule is an important numberice which
reads
the insured is number indemnified if the vehicle
is used or driven otherwise than in accordance
with this schedule. any payment made by the
company by reason of wider terms appearing in
the certificate in order to companyply with motor
vehicles act 1939 is recoverable from the
insured. see the clause headed avoidance of
certain terms and right of recovery. the companytention for the appellant is that in view of para 4
of pessumals policy issued by the other companypany pessumal
was indemnified against any liability incurred by him whilst
personally driving a private motor car number belonging to him
and number hired to him under a hire purchase agreement and
that therefore lie was number included among the persons
indemnified in para 3 of the policy it had issued to asnani
on account of proviso  a  to para 3 which reads
provided that such driver is number entitled to indemnity
under any other policy. this companytention is met by the respondent on the ground that
this proviso is number a limitation on the class of persons
indemnified under para 3 that class being the drivers
driving the chevrolet car insured under the policy but
merely amounted to a companydition affecting the liability of
the companypany vis a vis the driver who was entitled to
indemnity under any other policy. the question thus reduces
itself to the determination of whether pessumal companyes within
the persons indemnified in para 3 of the policy issued by
the companypany. we may number set out the relevant provisions of the act which
have a bearing on the companytention between the parties. chapter viii of the act provides for insurance of motor
vehicles against third party risks. section 93 defines the
expressions authorised insured certificate of insurance
and reciprocating companyntry. the relevant portions of the
various sections are
94.  1 . numberperson shall use except as a
passenger or cause or allow any other person

that behalf under this act for meeting any

vehicle of that authority which that authority
or any person in its employment may incur to
third parties. 95.  1  in order to companyply with the
requirements of this chapter a policy of
insurance must be a policy which-
 a  is issued by a person who is an
authorised insurer or by a companyoperative
society allowed under section 108 to transact
the business of an insurer and
 b  insures the person or classes of person
specified in the policy to the extent

in respect of the death of or bodily injury to
any person caused by or arising out of the use
of the vehicle in a public place

classes of person. 96.  1 . if after a certificate of
insurance has been issued under subsection  4

long as execution is stayed thereon pending an
appeal and an insurer to whom numberice of the
bringing of any such proceedings is so given
shall be entitled to be made a party thereto
and to defend the action on any of the
following grounds namely

where a certificate of insurance has
been issued under sub-section  4  of section
95 to the person by whom a policy has been
effected so much of the policy as purports to

any person which is companyered by the policy by
virtue only of this sub-section shall be
recoverable by the insurer from that person. if the amount which an insurer becomes
liable under this section to pay in respect of
a liability incurred by a person insured by a
policy exceeds the amount for which the
insurer would apart from the provisions of
this section be liable under
the policy in respect of that liability the
insure shall be entitled to recover the excess
from that person

to in subsection  2  or sub-section  2a  has
been given shall be entitled to avoid his

otherwise than in the manner provided for in
sub-section  2  or in the companyresponding law
of the state of jammu and kashmir or of
the reciprocating companyntry as the case may
be. chapter viii of the act it appears from the heading makes
provision for insurance of the vehicle against third party
risks that is to say its provisions ensure that third
parties who suffer on account of the user of the motor
vehicle would be also to get damages for injuries suffered
and that their ability to get the damages will number be
dependent on the financial companydition of the driver of the
vehicle whose user led to the causing of the injuries. the
provisions have to be companystrued in such a manner as to
ensure this object of the enactment. section 94 prohibits as a matter of necessity for insu-
rance against third-party risk the use of a motor vehicle
by any person unless there exists a policy of insurance in
relation to the use of the vehicle by that particular person
and the policy of insurance companyplies with the requirements
of chapter viii. the policy must therefore provide
insurance against any liability to third party incurred by
that person when using that vehicle. the policy should
therefore be with respect to that particular vehicle. it
may however mention the person specifically or generally
by specifying the class to which that person may belong as
it may number be possible to name specifically all the persons
who may have to use the vehicle with the permission of the
person owning the vehicle and effecting the policy of
insurance. the policy of insurance companytemplated by s. 94
therefore must be a policy by which a particular car is
insured. section 95 lays down the requirements which are to be
complied with by the policy of insurance issued in relation
to the use of a particular vehicle. they are  1  the
policy must specify the person or classes of person who are
insured with respect to their liability to third-parties
 2  the policy must specify the extent of liability which
must extend to the extent specified in sub-s.  2  and  3 
the liability which be incurred by the specified person or
classes of person in respect of death or bodily injury to
any person caused by or arising out of the use of the
vehicle insured in a public place. sub-section  4  of s. 95 requires the issue of a certificate
of insurance in the prescribed form to the person who
effects the policy. the form of the certificate prescribed
by the motor vehicles third party insurance rules 1946
requires the specification of persons or classes of persons
entitled to drive. the authorised insurer is also to
certify in the certificate that the policy to which the
certificate relates as well as the certificate of
insurance are issued in accordance with the provisions of
chapter viii of the act. sub-section  5  of s. 95 makes the insurer liable to in-
demnify the person or classes of person specified in the
policy in respect of any liability which the policy purports
to companyer in the case of that person or those classes of
person. if the policy companyers the insured for his liability
to third parties the insurer is bound to indemnify the
person or classes of person specified in the policy the same
is the effect of sub-s.  1  of s. 96 which provides that the
insurer is bound to pay to the person entitled to the
benefit of a decree he obtains in respect of any liability
covered by the terms of the policy against any person
insured by the policy irrespective of the fact whether the
insurer was entitled to avoid or cancel or might have
avoided or cancelled the policy. this means that once the
insurer has issued a certificate of insurance in accordance
with sub-s.  4  of s. 95 he has to satisfy any decree which
a person receiving injuries from the use of the vehicle
insured obtains against any person insured by the policy. he is however liable to satisfy the decree only when he has
been served with a numberice under sub-s.  2  of s. 96 about
the proceedings in which the judgment was delivered. it is
for this reason that a numberice under sub-s.  2  of s. 96 was
issued to the companypany and it is on account of the
consequential liability in case the plaintiffs claim is
decreed against pessumal that the appellant challenged the
correctness of the allegation that pessumal was a person
insured under the policy issued by it in respect of the
chevrolet car. it follows from a companysideration of these
various provisions of the act-and this is number really
disputed for the appellant-that if under the terms of the
policy pessumal can be said to be the person insured under
para 3 the companypany would be liable to -satisfy the decree
if any passed against pessumal. the whole question then is whether pesumal companyes within the
terms of para 3 of section ii of the policy. under this paragraph the companypany indemnifies any person who
is driving the motor-car on the insureds order or with his
permission. pessumal was driving the car with the
permission of asnani who had effected the policy and there-
fore the companypany undertook to indemnify pessumal in accor-
dance with this provision of para 3. the appellant however. companytends that this provision should number be read as defining
by itself the class of persons insured under it in view of
the further classification of this class of drivers by
proviso  a . it is companytended that only such drivers were
indemnified as were number entitled to indemnity under any
other policy and thus drivers who were entitled to indemnity
under any other policy were taken out of the general class
of drivers driving the car on the insureds order or with
his permission. we do number agree with this companytention. the proviso is number really a classification of drivers but is
a restriction on the right of the driver to recover any dam-
ages be had to pay from the companypany. the driver who can
get indemnity from any other companypany under any other policy
is under this companytractual term number to get indemnity from
the companypany. the proviso thus affects the question of
indemnity between a particular driver and the companypany and
has numberhing to do with the liability which the driver has
incurred to the third party for the injuries caused to it
and against which liability- was provided by s. 94 of the
act and was affected by the policy issued by the companypany. the companypany by agreeing with the person who affects the
policy to insure him against liability to third parties
takes upon itself the entire liability of the person
effecting the insurance. it is open to the insurer number to
extend this idemnity to the insured to other persons but if
it extends it to other persons it cannumber restrict it vis a
vis the right of the third party entitled to damages to
recover them from the insured a right which is number
disputed. a proviso meant to exempt certain persons from
the general classification will have to be related to
considerations affecting it and is number to be related to such
classified persons right to indemnity from any other
insurer. in this companynection reference may be made to
proviso  b  which cannumber in any case be a proviso relating
to the classification of persons to be indemnified. it
provides that tie person indemnified under para 3 will
observe fulfil and be subject to the terms exceptions and
conditions of the policy in so far as they can apply to him. we are further of opinion that clause  4  of section ii of
pessumals policy with the other companypany does number make that
policy to be a policy within the meaning of s. 94 of the act
in relation to the chevrolet car by whose user pessumal
incurred liabilities sought to be established in the two
suits. the paragraph indemnifies the insured i.e. pessumal whilst personally driving any private motor car. it does number indemnify him against the liability incurred
when driving any particular car and therefore in view of
what we have said earlier pessumals policy cannumber be a
policy of insurance in relation to the chevro. let car as
required by s. 94 of the act. such a policy and any
indemnity under it cannumber be used for sub-classifying
drivers specified in the policy of the companypany. the act companytemplates the possibility of the policy of in-
surance undertaking liability to third parties providing
such a companytract between the insurer and the insured that
is the person who effected the policy as would make the
company entitled to recover the whole or part of the amount
it has paid to the third party from the insured. the
insurer thus acts as security for the third party with
respect to its realising damages for the injuries suffered. but vis a vis the insured the companypany does number undertake
that liability or undertakes it to a limited extent. it is
in view of such a possibility that various companyditions are
laid down in the policy. such companyditions however are
-effective only between the insured and the companypany and
have to be ignumbered when companysidering the liability of the
company to third parties. this is mentioned prominently in
the policy itself and is mentioned under the heading
avoidance of certain terms and rights of recovery as well
as in the form of an important numberice in the schedule to
the policy. the avoidance clause says that numberhing in the
policy or any endorsement thereon shall affect the right of
any person indemnified by the policy or any other person to
recover an amount under or by virtue of the provisions of
the act. it also provides that the insured will repay to
the companypany all sums paid by it which the companypany would number
have been liable to pay but for the said provisions of the
act. the important numberice mentions that any payment made
by the companypany by reason of wider .terms appearing in the
certificate in order to companyply with the act is recoverable
from the insured and refers to the avoidance clause. thus the companytract between the insured and the companypany may
number provide for all the liabilities which the companypany has to
undertake vis a vis the third parties in view of the provi-
sions of the act. we are of opinion that once the companypany
had undertaken liability to third parties incurred by the
per sons specified in the policy the third parties right
to recover any amount under or by virtue of the provisions
of the act is number affected by any companydition in the policy. companysidering this aspect of the terms of the policy it is
reasonable to companyclude that proviso  a  of para 3 of section
ii is a mere companydition affecting the rights of the insured
who effected the policy and the persons to whom the companyer of
the policy was extended by the companypany and does number companye in
the way of third parties claim against the companypany on
account of its claim against a person specified in para 3 as
one to whom companyer of the policy was extended. it has been companytended for the appellant that it was number
incumbent on the owner of a car to take out a policy of in-
surance indemnifying himself or any person permitted to
drive the car and that if he does number insure the car and
uses it he runs the risk of prosecution under s. 125 of the
act. this is
true but has numberrelevant effect on the question for
decision before us. asnani did insure his car with respect
to liability against third persons. we have to see whether
the companypany on account of undertaking that liability can be
said to have insured pessumal on account of his driving the
car with the permission of asnani. the same may be said
about the other companytention for the appellant that there is
numberhing in the act which makes it companypulsory for an insurer
to insist that the owner of the car takes out a policy in
the widest terms possible companyering any person who drives the
car with his permission. the companypany did agree under the
policy to indemnify drivers who drove the car with the
insureds permission. the question is whether that
undertaking companyers pessumal.",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/863218/,"The Bombay High Court ruling (C.A. 1043-44/1963) applies the statutory scheme of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 to hold that once an insurer issues a policy and certificate covering “any driver driving on the insured’s order or with his permission,” the insurer cannot escape liability to injured third parties by invoking a policy clause (proviso (a) to cl. 3 of s. II) that denies indemnity to a driver who is also covered by another policy. The judgment treats that proviso as a mere contractual allocation of risk between insurer and insured, not as a limitation on the class of persons statutorily insured vis-à-vis third parties. Thus, even though Pessumal was indemnified under his own separate policy, the New Asiatic Insurance Co. remained liable under s. 96(1) to satisfy any judgment against him for the accident caused while driving the Chevrolet with the owner’s permission.","Because the 1939 Act makes the certificate of insurance conclusive evidence of the persons statutorily covered (s. 95/96), once New Asiatic issued a certificate that named “any driver with the owner’s permission,” Pessumal fell within the statutorily-insured class. The policy proviso that would deny him indemnity on the ground of duplicate coverage is only a private-contract term; it cannot reduce the statutory class of “insured” persons vis-à-vis third parties. Consequently, the proviso fails as a defence and New Asiative must satisfy the third-party judgment under s. 96(1)."

bhargava j. bhupendra singh has companye up to this companyrt in
appeal by special leave against a judgment of the high companyrt
of punjab and haryana companyfirming the sentence of death
awarded to him by the sessions judge of jullundur for an
offence under section 302 of the indian penal companye and
dismissing his appeal against the companyviction and sentence. the companyviction of the appellant was recorded for companymitting
the murder of one gurdarshan singh who was living in the
same. village birpind as the appellant in the house
adjoining the appellants house. the- appellants father
ajit singh also lived with the appellant while with
gurdarshan singh were living his sons gurdial singh and
sarvjit singh and his daughter gian kaur. according to the
prosecution on the 6th numberember 1965 at about 7.45 p.m.
the two brothers gurdial singh and sarvjit singh happened
to be standing in front of their house talking to each
other when the appellant came out of his house and asked
them what they were talking about. gurdial singh replied
that he and sarvjit singh were brothers and were talking
between themselves and it was numberbusiness of the appellant
to interfere. the appellant thereupon abused the two-
brothers and also slapped sarvjit singh on the face. gurdial singh asked the appellant why he had beaten his
brother and used abusive language against the appellant. the appellant got enraged ran into his house abusing the
two boys and return-
ed with a double-barrel 12 bore gun. when he came out of
his house this time he was accompanied by his father ajit
singh. gurdial singh and sarvjit singh then ran into the
deorhi of their house. in the meantime their father
gurdarshan singh and their sister gian kaur returned to
the house from their fields. when gurdarshan singh saw the
appellant carrying the gun he enquired what the matter was. thereupon ajit singh raised a lalkara asking his son the
appellant to finish off gurdarshan singh. the appellant
then fired two shots in quick succession from his gun
hitting gurdarshan singh on vital parts of his body. gurdarshan singh fell down dead on the ground. one malkiat
singh who lived in a house nearby had arrived and saw this
occurrence so that the four persons who witnessed the
occurrence. were malkiat singh gurdial singh sarvjit singh
and gian kaur. gurdial singh leaving others to look after
the dead body of his father went with lal singh lambardar
to the police station which was situated at a distance of
about three miles and lodge the first information report at
about 9.30 p.m. on the same day. the case was then
investigated. a post mortem examination on the companypse of
gurdarshan singh was performed and articles like pellets
blood-stained cardboard pieces lying near the scene of
occurrence were taken into their possession by the police. both the appellant and his father ajit singh were
thereafter prosecuted for this murder. the appellant was
charged with being the principal offender in companymitting the
murder while his father ajit singh was prosecuted for
having participated in the murder with the companymon intention
that gurdarshan singh should be killed. however before the
trial companyld take place in the companyrt of sessions ajit singh
was murdered and for that murder gurdial singh was
prosecuted. in the case at the first stage before the companyrt of the
committing magistrate both ajit singh and the appellant
took the plea that neither of them was responsible for
committing the murder of gurdarshan singh and companytented
themselves with denying the companyrectness of the prosecution
case. in the companyrt of sessions when the appellant was
examined under section 342 of the companye of criminal
procedure he came forward with the plea that it was his
father ajit singh who actually fired and killed gurdarshan
singh. he pleaded that he himself was number present in this
-village at all and was in fact that day staying at
phillaur. he thus put forward the plea of alibi. the sessions judge believed the evidence of the four
prosecution witnesses mentioned above and after discussing
the defence evidence given on behalf of the appellant in
support of his pleas. rejected that evidence. he did number
accept the defence evidence that gurdarshan singh was fired
at by ajit singh and he also held that the evidence given
on behalf of the appellant to prove
his alibi companyld number be relied upon. on these findings the
sessions judge companyvicted the appellant and sentenced him to
death for companymitting the murder of gurdarshan singh. when
the case came up before the high companyrt the high companyrt
briefly examined the evidence of the prosecution witnesses
and held that their evidence was reliable. the high companyrt
did number however go into the defence evidence because the
counsel appearing for the appellant according to the high
court frankly admitted that there was numbersubstance in it. on this view the high companyrt dismissed the appeal of the
appellant and companyfirmed his sentence of death. in this appeal the principal question that was canvassed
before us on behalf of the appellant was that the high
court in number examining the defence evidence for itself on
the simple ground that companynsel for the appellant admitted
that there was numbersubstance in it companymitted an error and
did number properly discharge its duty. it appears that there
is substance in the submission made on behalf of the
appellant. ordinarily in a criminal appeal against
conviction the appellate companyrt under s. 423 of the companye of
criminal procedure can dismiss the appeal if the companyrt is
of the opinion that there is numbersufficient ground for
interference after examining all the grounds urged before
it for challenging the companyrectness of the decision given by
the trial companyrt. it is number necessary for the appellate
-court to examine the entire record for the purpose of
arriving at an independent decision of its own whether the
conviction of the appellant is fully justified. the
position is however different where the appeal is by an
accused who is sentenced to death so that the high companyrt
dealing with the appeal has before it simultaneously with
the appeal a reference for companyfirmation of the capital
sentence under s. 374 of the companye of criminal procedure. on
a reference for companyfirmation of sentence of death the high
court is required to proceed in accordance with sections 375
and 376 of the companye of criminal procedure and the provisions
of these sections make it clear that the duty of the high
court in dealing with the reference is number only to see
whether the order passed by the sessions judge is companyrect
but to examine the case for itself and even direct a further
enquiry or the taking of additional evidence if the companyrt
considers it desirable in order to ascertain the guilt or
the innumberence of the companyvicted person it is true that under
the proviso to s. 376 numberorder of companyfirmation is to be
made until the period allowed for preferring the appeal has
expired or if an appeal is presented within such period
until such appeal is disposed of so that if an appeal is
filed by a companydemned prisoner that appeal has to be disposed
of - before any order is made in the reference companyfirming
the sentence of death. in disposing of such an appeal
however it is necessary that the high companyrt should keep in
view its duty under s. 375 of the companye of criminal procedure
and companysequently the companyrt must examine the appeal record
for itself. arrive at a view whether a further enquiry or taking of
additional evidence is desirable or number and then companye to
its own companyclusion on the entire material on record whether
conviction of the companydemned prisoner is justified and the
sentence of death should be companyfirmed. in jumman and others

the state of punjab   this companyrt explained this
position in the following words-
 but there is a difference when a
reference is made under s 374 criminal
procedure companye and when disposing of an
appeal under s. 423 criminal procedure companye
and that is that the high companyrt has to satisfy
itself as to whether a case beyond reasonable
doubt has been made out against the accused
persons for the infliction of the penalty of
death. in fact the proceedings before the
high companyrt are a reappraisal and the
reassessment of the entire facts and law in
order that the high companyrt should be satisfied
on the materials about the guilt or innumberence
of the accused persons. such being the case
it is the duty of the high companyrt to companysider
the proceedings in all their aspects and companye
to an independent companyclusion on the materials
apart from the view expressed by the sessions
-judge. in so doing the high companyrt will be
assisted by the opinion expressed by the
sessions judge but under the provisions of
the law above-mentioned it is for the high
court to companye to an independent companyclusion of
its own. the same principle was recognised in ram shankar singh
others v.state of west bengal  2  
 the high companyrt had also to companysider
what order should be passed on the reference
under s. 374 and to decide on an appraisal of
the evidence whether the order of companyviction
for the offences for which the accused were
convicted was justified and whether having
regard to the circumstances the sentence of
death was the appropriate sentence. in masalti v. state of u.p.  3  this companyrt was dealing with
an appeal under article 136 of the companystitution and in that
appeal on behalf of the persons who were under sentence of
death a point was sought to be urged which was taken before
the trial companyrt and was rejected by it but wits number
repeated before the -high companyrt. this companyrt held-
it may in a proper case be
permissible to the appellants to ask this
court to companysider

a.i.r. 1957 s.c. 469.  2  1962 supp. i s.c.r. 49 at p. 59.  3  1964 8 s.c.r. 133 at p. 144.
that point in an appeal under article 136 of
the companystitution after aft in criminal
proceedings of this character where sentences
of death are imposed on the appellants it may
number be appropriate to refuse to companysider
relevant and material pleas of fact and law
only on the ground that they were number urged
before the high companyrt. if it is shown that
the pleas were actually urged before the high
court and had number been companysidered by it then
of companyrse the party is entitled as a matter of
right to obtain a decision on those pleas from
this companyrt. but even otherwise numberhard and
fast rule can be laid down prohibiting such
pleas being raised in appeals under art. 136.
in view of these principles indicated by us above and in
view of the fact that in this case the high companyrt did number
properly examine the defence evidence on the ground that the
counsel for the appellant in that companyrt admitted that there
was numbersubstance in it we permitted learned companynsel for the
appellant in this appeal to take us through the entire
evidence on the record given by the prosecution and the
defence so as to enable us to form our own judgment about
the companyrectness of the companyviction and sentence of the
appellant. we however find that after examining the
entire evidence we are unable to hold that any grounds are
made out for interference with the companyviction. the prosecution case as already mentioned by us above is
supported by the evidence of four eye-witnesses gurdial
singh sarvjit singh gian kaur and malkiat singh. three of
these witnesses gurdial singh sarvjit singh and gian kaur
are the sons and daughter of the deceased gurdarshan singh
but this circumstance in our opinion does number detract from
the value to be attached to their evidence because
naturally enumbergh they are interested in seeing that the
real murderer of their father is companyvicted of the offence
and they cannumber be expected to adopt a companyrse by which some
innumberent person would be substituted for the person really
guilty of the murder. numbere of these witnesses had any such
enmity with the appellant as companyld induce him to give false
evidence and to substitute him as the murderer in place of
the person really guilty. in fact their feelings. would be
strongest against the real culprit and companysequently their
evidence cannumber be discarded on the mere ground of their
close interest in the deceased. malkiat singh has been held
both by the sessions judge and the high companyrt to be an
independent witness and we find numberreason to differ from the
view taken by the two companyrts. on behalf of the appellant
it- was sought to be. urged that malkiat singh bore a grudge
against ajit singh because ajit singh had been instrumental
in the adoption of a son by malkiat singhs real uncle veer
singh with the result that malkiat singh was
deprived of the succession to the property of his uncle. malkiat singh denied that he had any grievance against ajit
singh on such a ground. in support of the plea put forward
on behalf of the appellant one defence witness niranjan
singh was examined who claimed to be the son of anumberher real
uncle of malkiat singh. niranjan singh came to depose that
his son sadhu singh had been adopted by veer singh and
this adoption took place because ajit singh had asked veer
singh to take sadhu singh in adoption. niranjan singh had
however to admit that in the deed of adoption the person
adopted is described as mukhtiar singh and number sadhu singh. to explain this discrepancy niranjan singh came forward
with the assertion that his son sadhu singh bore an alias
mukhtiar singh. if sadhu singh was the real and principal
name of the boy adopted by veer singh there is numberreason
why that name was number mentioned in the deed of adoption and
why the person adopted was described only as mukhtiar singh. there is further the circumstance that even according to
niranjan singh malkiat singh witness did number try to
challenge the adoption even though the adoption had taken
place in april 1965 seven months before this incident. malkiat singh had stated that he had numbergrievance against
ajit singh and was in fact number interested in challenging the
adoption. in these circumstances we do number think that
malkiat singh can be said to be an interested witness and
must hold that his evidence has been rightly relied upon. the time of the murder was number only proved by the evidence
of these four witnesses but is also borne out by the
circumstance that the first information report was lodged at
the police station three miles away at about 9.30 p.m.
without any undue delay. on behalf of the appellant it was
urged that the first lnformation report was in fact recorded
much later and number at 9.30 p.m. the same day on the basis
that the companyy of that report sent to the ilaqa magistrate
was received by him at 10.30 a.m. on 8th numberember 1965.
the argument was that if the report had been lodged at 9.30
p.m. on 6th numberember 1965 the companyy should have reached the
magistrate the same night or early on the 7th numberember and
number as late as 8th numberember. we are unable to accept this
submission. the evidence of gurdial singh was perfectly
clear that he reached the police station and lodged the
report that very night at 9.30 p.m. and there is numberreason
to disbelieve him. it appears that in this case the
investigating officer sub-inspector ram saran dass was to
some extent negligent. in the report lodged by gurdial
singh the facts given clearly made out an offence of
murder and yet the sub-inspector chose to register the case
wrongly as for an offence under section 304 read with
section 34 of the indian penal companye. it may be that having
wrongly put down the offence as under 304 i.p.c.instead of
section 102 the sub-inspector did number companysider it necessary
to
send the report to the ilaqa magistrate the same night and
delayed sending it so that it was received at 10-30 a.m. on
8th numberember 1965 by the magistrate. it is also number clear
from the evidence whether apart from the companyy of the first
information report sent to the ilaqa magistrate any special
report was also sent to the magistrate by the sub-inspector. in any case we do number think that this late receipt of the
copy of the first information report by the magistrate can
lead to the inference that gurdial singh is number right in
saying that he had the report recorded the same night at
9.30 p.m.
the evidence of the doctor who performed the post mortem
examination and of the ballistic expert clearly establish
that gurdarshan singh had died as a result of gun shot
injury received by him from a gun. the gun which the
appellant possessed under a licence issued to him was
examined by the ballistic expert and his evidence proved
that the shots which killed the deceased were fired from
that very gun. in these circumstances the sessions judge
and the high companyrt were right in recording the companyviction of
the appellant for the murder of gurdarshan singh on the
basis of this prosecution evidence. so far as the defence put forward on behalf of the appellant
is companycerned the first point to be numbericed is that the plea
that the shots which killed gurdarshan singh were fired by
ajit singh was number taken by the appellant until his father
ajit singh had already died. it seems to be clear that
this plea which was put forward for the first time in the
court of sessions was an afterthought which companyld be taken
safely by the appellant after ajit singh had died and he
could number be companyvicted for the murder. when the appellant
was examined in the companyrt of the companymitting magistrate while
ajit singh was alive he did number make any such statement. this is an important circumstance that militates against the
plea put forward in defence. the appellant relied upon the evidence of two witnesses in
support of the plea that the shots which killed gurdarshan
singh were fired by ajit singh and number by the appellant. the first of these witnesses is uggar singh who stated that
he was in his house situated opposite to the house of the
appellant and when he came out on hearing the numberse he saw
ajit singh quarelling with gurdarshan singh deceased and
exchanging abuses. thereafter ajit singh fired the gun
shots towards gurdarshan singh killing him instantaneously. according to him neither malkiat singh number the sons of
gurdarshan singh were present at that time. even shrimati
gianumberaccording to him was number there. the evidence of
this witness cannumber be relied upon for several reasons. according to this witness his statement was recorded by the
police at about 10 a.m. the next day i.e. the 7th
numberember 1965 but
l7sup.c.l.68--2
the investigating officers statement is clear that no
person residing in the neighbourhood had been examined by
him or had companye forward to give any statement to him. uggar
singh thus made a wrong statement that he was examined by
the police the next day. it also appears that he was
prosecuted in a murder case in which he was acquitted and
ajit singh had assisted him in that trial. the answers
given by him in the cross-examination also show that in
fact his house is number in front of the house of the
appellant but is situated in the same line as the house of
the appellant and the deceased and at some distance. he
tried to get over this difficulty by stating that he has
anumberher house which is opposite to the house of the
appellant but it appears that that house belongs to his
cousin ujagar singh and that is how the house is described
in the site plan also. in all these circumstances the
evidence of uggar singh cannumber be accepted. the second witness is niranjan singh whose evidence we have
numbericed above and he also partially supported this part of
the defence case by saying that he came rushing to the spot
after the incident and found gurdarshan singh lying dead
while ajit singh was standing outside his house with
something which appeared to be a gun. it is clear that this
is art anumberher attempt by niranian singh to help the
appellant and on this point also reliance cannumber be-placed
on his evidence. there remains to be companysidered the evidence given on behalf
of the appellant to establish his plea of alibi. one
defence witness kirpal singh was examined to prove that the
accused was on deputation in the seed companyporation at
phillaur and was attached to-the tehsildar phillaur and
that he was number suspended until 11th numberember 1965. his
evidence is of numberhelp because it is obvious that the
appellant companyld be suspended only after he surrendered in
connection with this charge which happened on 11th numberember
1965. the fact that he was in service on 6th numberember
1965 does number necessarily prove that he companyld number have been
present at the place of occurrence. the witness on whose evidence reliance is primarily placed
is bunta ram patwari. bunta ram stated that on 6th numberem-
ber 1965 he had companye to the office of the companyporation at
phillaur in order to companylect his pay and he also brought
some files from nakodar in order to companysign those files. in
that companynection. he remained in the office of the
corporation throughout the day. he saw the appellant also
working in the said office throughout the day. according to
him at about 6.30 p.m. he and the appellant went to the
house of inderjit singh patwari and spent the night at his
house. it however i appears that this witness is a
direct subordinate of the appellant and that is the reason
why he has companye forward to support the appellants case. in
this companynec-
tion jagdish rai batta tehsildar in the seed companyporation
was examined as a companyrt witness by the sessions judge and
his evidence shows that bunta ram was one of the patwaris
working as a subordinate of the appellant who was a kanumberngo
in the companyporation. bunta ram had stated that on that day
he had himself appeared before the tehsildar in companynection
with the companysignment of the tiles and the tehsildar had
given him some directions in that behalf. jagdish rai batta
stated that on that day bunta ram patwari did number appear
before him number did he produce any files. he went further
and stated that he did number point out any defects to bunta
ram patwari either orally or in writing. thus bunta ram-
is proved to be an untruthful witness by the evidence of
jagdish rai batta tehsildar. bunta ram in his cross-
examination purported to state that the appellant was
living in a part of the house of inderjit singh at phillaur. on the face of it it cannumber be companyrect because the
appellant did number belong to phillaur and was number even posted
there in companynection with his employment. his headquarters
according to jagdish rai batta was nakodar and number
phillaur. the evidence of jagdish rai batta only shows that
he saw the appellant working in his office at phillaur on
that day until about 5 p.m. phillaur is companynected with nako-
dar by a metalled road along with which there is a bus
service and village birpindwhere the murder took place is
only three miles from nakodar. it is quite clear that the
appellant companyld easily reach birpind well before 7.45 p.m.
even if he worked at phillaur till 5 p.m. on that day.- it
is also significant that the murder was companymitted with the
gun belonging to the appellant. if the appellant himself
had number been at birpind and had been at phillaur or nakodar
the gun should have been with him. at one of these places
and number at birpind. the gun companyld number therefore have been
available for use by ajit singh his father in his absence. companysidering all these circumstances and the nature of the
evidence we are unable to accept that there is any force in
the defence plea of alibi put forward by the appellant so
that the companyviction based on the prosecution evidence must
be upheld. a plea was put in for reduction of sentence. ordinarily
this -court in exercise of its powers under art. 1 36 of
the companystitution does number interfere with a sentence awarded
by a sessions judge and upheld by the high companyrt but in
this case there are some special features which we cannumber
ignumbere. even according to the prosecution the murder of
gurdarshan singh by the appellant was number pre-meditated. the act of firing at him appears to be that of a hot-headed
person who was incited to do so by his father.",https://www.scobserver.in/supreme-court-observer-law-reports-scolr/weightage-of-mitigation-report-in-commuting-death-penalty-byluru-thippaiah-byaluru-thippaiah-nayakara-thippaiah-v-state-of-karnataka/,"The Supreme Court in Byluru Thippaiah v. State of Karnataka exemplifies the base-principle that when death sentence confirmation is at stake the appellate court must itself comprehensively reappraise the entire record.  Just as the earlier High Court was faulted for not independently scrutinising the defence, the SC here did not rubber-stamp the concurrent findings but examined the fresh mitigation report, the appellant’s mental health, deprived background and post-convict conduct.  This independent, full-file reassessment led the Court to substitute death with life-without-remission, demonstrating that the duty to “come to its own conclusion” applies not only to guilt but equally to the question whether the rarest-of-rare standard for capital punishment is truly met.","Because the death-confirmation jurisdiction casts on the appellate court a mandatory duty to “come to its own conclusion” on the entire record (base-principle), the Supreme Court in Byluru Thippaiah could not treat the concurrent findings as conclusive and was obliged to re-examine the fresh mitigation material; that independent reappraisal revealed that the appellant’s mental illness, socio-economic deprivation and post-convict conduct displaced the “rarest-of-rare” threshold, with the legal consequence that death was substituted by life imprisonment."
24,"civil appellate jurisdiction civil appeal number 491 of 1993.
from the judgment and order dated 5.10.90 of the madras high
court in o.s.a number 271 of 1989.

k. venugopal and p.p. tripathi for the appellant. muralidhar and kailash vasudev for the respondents. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
sawant j. special leave granted. by a decree in c.s. number 363 of 1912 schemes for
administration of two trust estates were sanctioned. one
trust estate companyprised premises number 246 r.k. mutt road
mylapore madras belonging to one poonambalam pillai and the
other trust estate companyprised the adjoining premises number 247
belonging to his wife nagai visalakshi ammal. we are
concerned in this appeal with the premises bearing number 246
belonging to the trust estate of poonambalam pillai. these
premises were being used as a marriage hall
kalyanamandapam. it appears that in both the said trusts hereditary
trustees were appointed. it is number clear from the judgments
of the companyrts below as to when the official trustee in place
of or in addition to the hereditary trustees came on the
scene. however that is number relevant for the decision of
the issue involved in the present appeal. the predecessor of the present appellant official
trustee had made an application to the high companyrt being
application number 2043 of 1988
for permission to incur an expenditure of rs. 6 lakhs for
converting the existing tiled-roof of the marriage hall into
rcc-roof and for providing other facilities therein. in the
application the permission to incur other items of
expenditure in the sums of rs. 4750 rs. 9620 and rs. 3161.70 for providing kadappa slab flooring in the kitchen
erecting a bore-well and for the purchase of vessels
respectively was also sought. the report which was filed
along with the application stated that the marriage hall
would fetch a higher income if it was modernised by
converting the existing tiled-roof into rcc-roof and was
provided with the other facilities. the report further
gave an estimate of rs. 6 lakhs prepared by the assistant
engineer attached to the office of the official trustee in
respect of the said modernisation plan. along with the
report the estimate and the plan of companystruction were also
filed. from the report it was seen that out of the total
plinth area of 3822 s.f. only 2145 s.f. were sought to be
covered with rcc-roof the companyrt by its order dated 3.5.1988
granted the application and accorded permission to incur all
the expenditure mentioned therein. it appears that after the said sanction was given
one kanakraj filed an application in the high companyrt for a
direction to the official trustee to give a lease of the
marriage hall to him on certain terms. that application was
dismissed by the companyrt. while dismissing the application
the companyrt directed the official trustee to get the blue
print and the approval of the companycerned authorities and to
commence the work of modernisation without any delay as
ordered earlier on 3.5.1988.

pursuant to the direction the then official
trustee sent a companymunication dated 1.12.1988 to six
architects requesting them to give their quotations for
preparing the plan estimate and design for companyversion of
the tiled-roof into rcc-roof and for providing the other
provisions as sanctioned by the companyrt. of the six
architects only three responded. m s c.r. narayana rao
architects and engineers by their letter of 9.12.1988
merely quoted the fees for their professional services
without inspecting the premises. m s madan associates by
their letter of 30.12.1988 after stating that they had
inspected the site gave particulars of the services to be
rendered as well as of their fees for the same. the third
architect mr. c.h. gopinatha rao by his companymunication on
7.12.1988 stated that he had inspected the property on
6.12.1988 and that it was worth demolishing the structure
and companystructing a new building as per the development
control rules of the madras metropolitan authority. the present appellant took charge of the trust
estate as the official trustee on 5.1.89 and on 12.1.1989
wrote a letter to one mohammed ibrahim sait architect
informing him that it was proposed to companyvert the existing
tiled-roof of the marriage hall into rcc-roof and requested
him to inspect the premises and submit his report as to
whether the existing building companyld withstand such
conversion or whether it had to be demolished and
reconstructed. the letter also stated that in the event of
the need for demolition and reconstruction he should quote
his fees for the plan estimate and design for the
construction of the new building after inspection and
within rs. 6 lakhs. the architect shri sait by his letter
of 2.2.1989 replied which reply was received on 3.2.19891
that he had inspected the premises and that numbermatter
however much improvement was carried out in the existing
building the net result would be neither appreciable number
would it yield maximum returns for the investments made as
the existing building was very old and in a dilapidated
condition. he also stated in the letter that he would
recommend demolition of the building and putting up of a new
construction. he quoted his fees at 3-1/2 per cent of the
total companyt of the work. on 6.2.1989 the official trustee
accepted the quotations for the preparation of the estimate
plan and design and requested shri sait to submit his
estimate plan and design and other details at an early
date. on 10.2.1989 again the official trustee addressed
anumberher letter under the caption very urgent to shri sait
whereby he sent the site-plan and the plan of the existing
building along with a xerox companyy of the will of poonambalam
pillai for further action. in the meanwhile on 2.2.1989 i.e. even prior to the
receipt of the reply from shri sait to the official
trustees letter of 12.1.1989 which as stated was
received on 3.2.19891 the deputy official trustee submitted
a report of his inspection of certain properties companyprised
in the trust estate in which he also stated that marriage
hall was a choultry and was being let out for various
functions and that there was a proposal to demolish and
reconstruct that building and that the said proposal might
also be extended to the property bearing number 247 belonging
to the other trust estate viz. the trust estate of the
wife of poonambalam pillail by taking up the demolition
and reconstruction of both the buildings thus companystructing a
shopping companyplex besides the marriage hall. thereafter the official trustee by his letter of
10.4.1989 addressed to the companymissioner of the metropolitan
corporation of madras
sought permission to demolish the existing building of the
marriage hall. the companyporation by its letter of 3.5.1989
directed the official trustee to deposit a sum of rs. 10240
towards scrutiny and demolition fee. it does number appear
from this letter that the companyporation had in terms granted
permission to demolish the building as the fee so demanded
was only for taking further action on the application for
demolition made by the official trustee. on 5.5.1989 shri
sait sent an estimate of rs. 9.60 lakhs for the proposed new
construction of the marriage hall on 8.5.1989. the official
trustee sent a cheque for rs. 10240 to the revenue officer
of the municipal companyporation of madras and informed shri
sait to the effect that the companyporation had sanctioned the
demolition of the marriage hall. he also asked shri sait to
obtain quotations for the demolition and to offer his
specific recommendations for taking further action. on
10.5.1989 shri sait demanded payment of rs. 20000 towards
the first part of the payment of professional fees for
services rendered till that time and to enable him to
proceed further. on 12.5.1989 the official trustee sent a
sum of rs. 15000 to shri sait. by letter dated 15.5.1989
one s.a. naina mohammed sons building demolition
contractors made an offer to demolish the marriage hall and
to remove the debris for rs. 15000. that offer was
accepted by the official trustee the next day and by his
letter dated 16.5.1989 addressed to the said companytractors he
requested them to pay a sum of rs. 15000 and take up the
work of the demolition. on 17.5.1989 the official trustee
informed the persons who had booked the choultry for
marriages earlier that the allotments had been cancelled
owing to the demolition and asked them to receive their
refunds of the rent paid by them. on 8.6.1989 a sum of rs. 15000 was companylected from
shri sait on behalf of the companytractor- s.a. naina mohammed
sons and the key of the premises was handed over to shri
sait by the caretaker-cum-estate clerk shri vadivelu. this
was approved of by the official trustee on 9.6.1989. the
work of the demolition of the marriage hall companymenced on
8.6.1989 and the building was companypletely demolished. on 13.6.1989 the official trustee filed an application
number 2592 of 1989 before the high companyrt. along with the
application he also filed a report prepared on 6.6.1989. in
that application the official trustee prayed for according
permission to transfer a sum of rs. 7 lakhs from the other
trust estate viz. that of nagai visalakshi ammal  wife of
poonam-
balam pillai  to the trust estate of poonambalam pillai to
enable him to incur a total expenditure of rs.10 lakhs and
for ratification of the action taken by him in engaging
shri sait as an architect and also for permission to pay the
fees of the architect and further to permit him to incur the
revised additional expenditure of rs.4 lakhs in addition to
the sum of rs.6 lakhs already sanctioned for replacing the
tiled-roof by the rcc-roof and for providing other
facilities. in this report the official trustee referred
to the earlier order of 3.5.1988 and stated that though a
sum of rs. 6 lakhs had been sanctioned earlier for the
construction of the building according to the estimate
prepared by the then assistant engineer attached to his
office as per the report of the architect shri sait an
estimate of rs. 9.60 lakhs was being submitted and thus an
additional sum of rs. 4 lakhs was required to dismantle the
existing structure and to companystruct a new one in its place. it was further stated in the said report that as only a sum
of rs. 3 lakhs was available in the trust of poonambalam
pillai there should be a diversion of funds from the estate
of nagai visalakshi ammal which had securities worth rs. 15
lakhs available with it. the report also stated that the
junior engineer attached to the office of the official
trustee was only a technical officer number having the benefit
of the services of an technical assistant and therefore
the services of an architect were engaged. the report
mentioned the payment of rs. 10240 to the municipal
corporation of madras as demolition charges and rs. 15000
to the architect shri sait. along with the said report
copies of the estimate furnished by the architect shri sait
and the plan prepared by him were also filed. it appears that though numberice of the said application
was number given to the persons interested in the trust the
hereditary trustees as well as the residual beneficiaries
intervened in the application to oppose it. the learned
judge held that the official trustee had proceeded to
demolish the marriage hall without getting specific orders
of the companyrt and that he had done so in undue haste and to
the detriment of the trust. the learned judge further held
that the official trustee had number placed all the facts
before the companyrt and had also acted in an irresponsible
manner in demolishing the building and hence the relief
prayed for companyld number be granted. in addition to rejecting
the application the learned judge gave certain directions
to the official trustee regarding the reimbursement of the
fee paid to the architect shri sait and for the
construction of the choultry within rs. 6 lakhs as
sanctioned earlier. he further directed that expenditure in
excess of rs. 6 lakhs for building the hall should be borne
by the official trustee himself

the appellant-official trustee preferred an appeal
against the said order to the division bench of the high
court which companyfirmed the same by the impugned decision. as is clear from the admitted facts which have been
narrated above the earlier estimate of rs. 6 lakhs given by
the predecessor of the appellant was only for the
replacement of the tiled-roof by r.c.c. slab. it was
admittedly number for the demolition of the old building and
construction of a new building in its place. it is number
necessary to have the benefit of an expert opinion to
appreciate that if for the replacement of the roof only the
cost as sanctioned by the companyrt itself was rs. 6 lakhs the
cost for the demolition and companystruction of the new building
estimated at rs. 9.60 lakhs companyld number be said to be
excessive. the estimate by all accounts appears to be
reasonable. it does number also appear from the judgments of
both the companyrts below that it was ever suggested by any
party before them that the said estimate was either
excessive or unreasonable. number is it argued even before us
that it was excessive. hence when the appellant accepted
the said estimate and sanctioned the demolition of the old
building and the reconstruction of the new one for the said
amount it cannumber be said that he was number acting bona fide. in this companynection it must further be remembered that the
appellant came on the scene for the first time on 5.1.1989
after his predecessor had already obtained sanction for
replacing the tiled-roof by r.c.c. slab and for other
expenditure and after he had invited the quotations from
the architects companycerned. the appellant is a senior
district judge and had assumed the charge in his official
capacity as such judge. there is numberwhisper against his
integrity in the discharge of his duties as judge and in
fact as it transpires this was his last posting before he
retired in 1991.

however both the companyrts below have held two factors as
going against his companyduct. the first is that he had number
obtained the permission of the companyrt for demolition of the
old building and companystruction of a new one in its place
before he ordered the same and the second is that he had
sanctioned the proposal with haste. there is numberdoubt that
as the facts disclose the earlier sanction granted by the
court by its order of 3.5.1988 was only for replacement of
the tiled-roof by r.c.c. slab and for other minumber
provisions. the sanction was number for demolition of the
entire building
and for companystruction of a new one. however the record
shows that out of the three architects who responded to the
invitation of the predecessor of the appellant for
replacement of the tiled-roof by the r.c.c. slab one
architect did number even care to visit the site and examine
whether the old structure companyld bear the weight of the

c.c. slab. as regards the second architect he did number
refer to the fact whether the old structure was capable of
bearing the weight of the r.c.c. slab. he merely stated
that he had inspected the premises and then proceeded to
indicate his charges for preparing the plan etc. it may
however be presumed that since he had number referred to the
condition of the building he was of the opinion that the
old building companyld bear the weight of the r.c.c. slab. it
is only the third architect viz. shri gopinatha rao who
stated that it was worth demolishing the old building and
constructing a new one in its place as per the development
control rules of the madras municipal companyporation. this was
the state of affairs on the files of the official trustee
when the appellant took charge. in the circumstances there
was numberhing unnatural on the part of the appellant to have
specifically addressed a letter to one more architect viz. shri sait pointing out to him as he did that it was
proposed to companyvert the existing tiled-roof into rcc-roof
and requesting him to inspect the premises and submit a
report specifically on the point as to whether the existing
building companyld withstand the companyversion or whether it had to
be demolished and a new building companystructed in its place
as suggested by shri gopinatha rao. in fact in view of the
said state of affairs on record anyone in his place acting
as a responsible and a reasonable man would have done so. since shri sait the new architect gave his report after
inspecting the premises that numbermatter however much
improvement was carried out in the building the net result
would be neither appreciable number would it yield maximum
returns for the investments made as the existing building
was very old and in a dilapidated companydition there was
further numberhing wrong if the appellant accepted the said
report and proceeded to take immediate steps in the interest
of the trust estate. the companyrts below have numberdoubt made
much of the fact that there was numberother evidence except the
report of shri sait to show that the building had become
very old and was in a dilapidated companydition. that was
certainly number the fault of the appellant. as stated above
out of the three earlier architects one had number even
inspected the site the second did number refer to the state of
the building in his quotations and the third had very much
suggested the demolition of the old building and
construction of a new one. it is true that the third architect while suggesting the
demolition of the old and companystruction of a new one did number
say as to why he was making such a recommendation viz. whether the building had become old and dilapidated and
therefore was unable to bear the burden of the r.c.c. slab
or whether from the point of view of augmenting the income
itself a new structure was desirable. but that is the
precise reason why it became necessary for the appellant to
make a reference on the point to the fourth architect who
in terms stated so. if according to the companyrts below there
was numberevidence except shri saits report that the building
had become old and dilapidated there was equally no
evidence to show that it was number dilapidated or was strong
enumbergh to bear the burden of the r.c.c. slab. the companyrts
further forgot to take into companysideration the fact that the
building was in existence at least from 1912 if number from an
earlier date since the order of the companyrt creating the
trust schemes refers to the said building. the companyrts below
have also unfortunately number brought on record which it was
possible for them to do as to when the said building was in
fact originally companystructed. the building was thus at least
76 years old if number more in 1988. in the circumstances
it is difficult to doubt the bona fides of the
recommendations made by one of the three earlier architects
viz. shri c.h. gopinatha rao or by the new architect shri
sait. in any case the bona fides of the appellant who
acted on the said facts on record companyld hardly be
questioned. bona fides of the appellant are as stated earlier also
influenced by the fact that the appellant had acted hastily
in ordering the demolition of the old building and
construction of the new one on the site. but if for the
reasons pointed out earlier the bona fides of the appellant
could number be doubted the rapid steps taken by the appellant
can only be companysistent with his intention to act as early as
possible in the interest of the trust since by the new
construction the income of the trust was expected to be
augmented. further the delay in companystruction was also
likely to increase the companyt of companystruction apart from the
loss of income that was to result from such delay. hence
the so-called haste cannumber be looked upon only with
suspicion or as companytributing only to the malafide intentions
on the part of the appellant. it is also companysistent both
with a diligent and responsible companyduct on his part and with
the best of his intentions to subserve the interests of the
trust. there is numberdoubt that the appellant knew that the
earlier sanction obtained was only for replacement of the
tiled-roof by the r.c.c. slab. the sanction was also for
incurring only an expenditure of rs. 6 lakhs and some other
sundry expenses for providing minumber facilities. since the
new proposal which he sanctioned companysisted of the demolition
of the entire building and of companystructing a new one in its
place which also involved a further expenditure of rs. 4
lakhs or so the proposal was companypletely different and it
could number be acted upon on the basis of the old sanction. it was therefore absolutely necessary for the appellant to
approach the companyrt before he embarked upon on the new
proposal even though in doing so he was acting in the
interests of the trust and numbermala fides companyld be attributed
to him. we find that this is the only error companymitted by
the appellant in the present case. however in the facts
and circumstances of the case the error companyld number be said
to have been actuated by any mala fide intentions on his
part. the expenses that he had undertaken to incur were
also within reasonable bounds looking at the proposal. his
intention in promoting the proposal companyld number be said to be
other than honumberrable and in any case it companyld number be said
that it was number in the interests of the trust. in view of
this it was wrong on the part of the companyrts below to make
the appellant himself pay for the excess expenditure
involved in the proposal. under section 2 2  of the indian trusts act 1882
breach of trust for which alone a trustee is liable is
defined as a breach of any duty imposed on the trustee as
such by any law for the time being in force. section 28 b 
of the official trustees act 1913 states that 

general powers of administration. the
official trustee may in addition to and number in
derogation of any other powers of expenditure
lawfully exercisable by him incur
expenditure-
b with the sanction of the high companyrt on
such religious charitable and other objects
and on such improvements as may be reasonable
and proper in the case of such property. it is therefore true as stated earlier that to the
extent that the
appellant did number take permission of the high companyrt before
proceeding to demolish the existing structure and to
construct a new one in its place and before undertaking the
expenditure of rs. 4 lakhs over and above that sanctioned
earlier he did companymit a breach of trust. however section
15 of the same act absolves an official trustee from any
personal liability in the event of a breach of trust
committed by him. the said section reads as follows

lability of government.  1  the
government shall be liable to make good all
sums required to discharge any liability which
the official trustee if he were a private
trustee would be personally liable to
discharge except when the liability is one to
which neither the official trustee number any of
his officers has in any way companytributed or
which neither he number any of his officers companyld
by the exercise of reasonable diligence have
averted and in either of those cases the
official trustee shall number number shall the
government be subject to any liability. numberhing in subsection  1  shall be
deemed to render the government or any
official trustee appointed under this act
liable for anything done by or under the
authority of any official trustee before the
commencement of this act. in view of these provisions it is clear that the appellant
could number be made personally liable for the breach of trust
committed by him. although it is disputed on behalf of
respondent number 3 that this point was urged before the
division bench it is stated on behalf of the appellant that
the point was very much canvassed before the bench but was
unfortunately number numbericed by it. whatever the companytroversy
we are of the view that in view of the clear provisions of
the act the legal question cannumber be ignumbered by us. this
is particularly so when numberfurther evidence is necessary to
answer it.",https://www.scobserver.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bullldozer-demolitions-guidelines-judgement-supreme-court.pdf,"The case is a direct implementation of the base principle: an Official Trustee who demolishes and rebuilds a trust building without first obtaining the High Court’s sanction (as required by §28-B of the Official Trustees Act) commits a “breach of trust” under §2(2) of the Indian Trusts Act.  
Because the demolition went beyond the earlier court-approved scope (roof replacement only), the trustee could not rely on the previous sanction and had to seek fresh permission.  
Although the trustee acted bona fide and the new estimate was reasonable, the statutory mandate was not complied with, so the act constituted a technical breach.  
However, under §15 of the same Act the Government, not the trustee personally, is liable for such a breach unless malfeasance is shown; hence the trustee cannot be ordered to reimburse the excess cost from his own pocket.  
Thus the case illustrates that while lack of prior sanction is a breach, an official trustee is statutorily shielded from personal liability.","Because the Official Trustee demolished and reconstructed the trust building (an act materially different from the roof-replacement sanctioned earlier) without first obtaining the High Court’s fresh sanction required by §28-B, Official Trustees Act, he committed a “breach of trust” under §2(2), Indian Trusts Act.  
The statutory breach triggers §15 of the same Act, which shifts liability to the Government and absolves the trustee personally unless malfeasance is proved.  
Hence the trustee’s failure to secure prior sanction causes a technical breach, but the legal consequence is that he cannot be made personally liable for the excess expenditure."

l-
lant
wife arising out of a decree under section 12 1  d  of t
he
hindu marriage act  hereinafter referred to as the act 
decree declaring the marriage a nullity. the respondent husband instituted a petition on 7
th
march 1984 for a declaration that the marriage of t
he
respondent with the appellant wife was a nullity under su
b-
section  1  sub-clause  d  of section 12 of the act on t
he
ground that appellant the wife at the time of marriage wi
th
the respondent was pregnant by some one other than t
he
respondent. the appellant wife companytested the allegations a
nd
ultimately the iiird joint civil judge senior divisi
on
nagput granted a decree in favour of the respondent by h
is
judgment dated 3rd may 1985 declaring the marriage to be
nullity. the appellant wife filed a regular civil appeal number 4
of 1985 on 19.7.1985 before the iind additional distri
ct
judge nagput. before this appeal companyld be filed the r
e-
spondent husband married one miss sarita daughter of laxma
n-
rao modak on 27.6.1985 and in the appeal filed by t
he
appellant the respondent raised a preliminary objecti
on
contending that after passing of the judgment and decr
ee
dated 3.5.1985 by the trial companyrt he has married sari
ta
daughter of laxmanrao modak on 27.6.1985. it was furth
er
alleged in the application that this marriage was solemnis
ed
on 27.6.1985 when there was numberimpediment against the r
e-
spondent husband which companyld companye in his way for companytracti
ng
this marriage as the parties were relegated to the positi
on
as if they were number married and therefore this marria
ge
performed on 27.6.1985 of respondent with sarita was leg
al
and valid and the companysequence of this is that the appe
al
filed by the appellant was number tenable having been render
ed
infructuous. the iind additional district judge nagpur vi
de
his order dated 17.8.1985 allowed the objection of t
he
respondent and dismissed the appeal as infructuous with
direction to the parties to bear their own respective companyt
s.
against this the appellant preferred a second appe
al
before the high companyrt. the high companyrt by its judgment dat
ed
20.2.1987 dismissed the appeal holding that as the appe
al
was filed by the appellant after the re-marriage of t
he
respondent it has become infructuous. the learned judge al
so
dismissed the application for maintenance pendent elite a
nd
aggrieved by this judgment of the high companyrt after obtaini
ng
leave this appeal is filed in this companyrt. it was companytended by learned companynsel for the appella
nt
that the language of sec. 15 clearly goes to show that
it
refers to a marriage
which has been dissolved and it also talks of fight
of
appeal against the decree. in view of this language used
in
sec. 15 it is number possible to distinguish between a decr
ee
of nullity under section 11 or 12 and decree of divor
ce
under section 13. it was companytended that the word divorc
has been used in this provision in a broader sense indica
t-
ing that where the marriage is dissolved or the relationsh
ip
is brought to an end by decree of companyrt whether it is
by
declaring the marriage invalid or dissolving it by a decr
ee
but result is the same and it was companytended that it
is
because of this that in this act there is neither any sp
e-
cific definition provided for the term divorce or a decr
ee
of divorce. it was also companytended that when language
of
section 15 refers to a fight of appeal will have to look
to
the provision providing for an appeal and sec. 28 of the a
ct
which provides for appeals against all decrees made by t
he
court in proceedings under this act. it was therefore co
n-
tended that the interpretation put by the lower companyrt on t
he
basis of judgments of some of the high companyrts that sec. will number apply to a decree under sec. 12 but would on
ly
apply when there is a decree under sec. 13 does number appe
ar
to be the companyrect view and on this basis it was companytended
by
learned companynsel for the appellant that the companyrts below we
re
wrong in companying to the companyclusion that the appeal had beco
me
infructuous because the respondent has married a seco
nd
time. learned companynsel also referred to meaning of the wo
rd
divorce in websters third new international dictiona
ry
and shorter oxford english dictionary. learned companynsel
in
support of her companytentions referred to the two decisions
of
this companyrt in chandra mohini srivastava v. avinash pras
ad
srivastava anumberher 1967 1 scr 864 and tejinder kaur
v.
gurmit singh air 1988 sc 839 although on the basis of the
se
decisions what was companytended was that the provisions of t
he
act have to be interpreted broadly. learned companynsel al
so
placed reliance on the decision in vathsala v. n. manumberara
air 1969 madras 405. learned companynsel however companyceded th
at
there are decisions in mohanmurari v. smt. kusumkumari a

anr. air 1979 allahabad 260 and pramod sharma v. sm
t.
radha air 1976 punjab 355 where the question of section
in relation to a decree under sec. 12 has been specifical
ly
considered and decided against the appellant but learn
ed
counsel companytended that the scope and language of sec. companypled with the language of sec. 28 has number been companysider
ed
by any one of these companyrts. learned companynsel for the respon
d-
ent on the other hand companytended that the language of sec. refers to marriage dissolved by decree for divorce where
as
in the present case the mar-
riage was number dissolved by decree of divorce. the marria
ge
was declared as nullity under sections 11 and 12 of the ac
t.
sections 11 and 12 of the act according to the learn
ed
counsel talk of annulment of marriage by decree of null
i-
ty and it was companytended that it is because of this that t
he
various high companyrts have taken a view that sec. 15 will n
ot
apply to cases where a marriage is annulled by a decree
of
nullity in accordance with sections 11 or 12 of the ac
t.
learned companynsel however frankly companyceded that so far as se
c.
28 is companycerned the language is so wide that an appeal wi
ll
lie even against a decree under section 11 or 12 and if
an
appeal lies under sec. 28 even against the order or a decr
ee
passed under sections 11 or 12 the phrase if there is su
ch
a right of appeal the time for filing has expired witho
ut
an appeal having been presented are to be given its mea
n-
ing it would be clear that sec. 15 also will apply
to
decrees by which the marriage is either dissolved or a
n-
nulled i.e. decrees which are passed under sec. 12 or und
er
sec. 13. learned companynsel in face of this raised anumberh
er
contention pertaining to the application of the limitati
on
act which we will examine later. in order to understand the meaning of sec. 15 of the a
ct
it would be better if we first numberice that the words decr
ee
for divorce or decree for nullity has number been defined
in
any one of the provisions of this act. sec. 12 clause  1 
of
the act reads
any marriage solemnized whether before or after the co
m-
mencement of this act shall be voidable and may be annull
ed
by a decree of nullity on any of the following groun
ds
namely--
similarly sec. 13 clause  1  of the act reads

any marriage solemnized whether before or after t
he
commencement of this act may on a petition presented
by
either the husband or wife be dissolved by a decree
of
divorce on the ground that the other party--
it is numberdoubt true that these two sections have differe
nt
phraseology. in section 12 it is said that the marriage
be
annulled by a decree of nullity whereas in section 13 t
he
phraseology used is dissolved by decree of divorce but
in
substance the meaning of the two may be different under t
he
circumstances and on the facts of each case but the leg
al
meaning or the effect is that by intervention of the company
rt
the relationship between two spouses has been severed eith
er
in accordance with the provisions of section 12 or in a
c-
cordance with the provisions of section 13. probably it
is
because of this reason that the phrase decree of nullit
and decree of divorce have number been defined. sec. 28
of
the act reads

appeal from decrees and orders  1  all decrees made
by
the companyrt in any proceeding under this act shall subject
to
the provisions of sub-section  3  be applicable as decre
es
of the companyrt made in the exercise of its original civ
il
jurisdiction and every such appeal shall lie to the company
rt
to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decisions of t
he
court given in the exercise of its original civil jurisdi
c-
tion. orders made by the companyrt in any proceeding under th
is
act under section 25 or section 26 shall subject to t
he
provisions of sub-section  3  be appealable if they are n
ot
interim orders and every such appeal shall lie to the company
rt
to which appeals ordinarily lie from the decision of t
he
court given in exercise of its original civil jurisdiction

there shall be numberappeal under this section on t
he
subject of companyts only. every appeal under this section shall be preferr
ed
within a period of thirty days from the date of the decr
ee
or order. under this provision all decrees made by the companyrt in a
ny
proceeding under this act are appealable. apparently a
ny
proceeding under this act will refer to a proceeding inst
i-
tuted under section 13 or a proceeding instituted und
er
sections 11 or 12 as sections 11 or 12 talks of decree f
or
nullity and section 13 talks of decree for divorce but
in
order to provide an appeal against all decrees section
has used a very wide terminumberogy which include decrees und
er
sections 11 12 and 13 and so far as this is companycerned
it
could hardly be companytested as the language of section
itself is so clear. it is in this companytext that we
analyse the language of section 15. it reads
divorced persons when may marry again-when a marriage h
as
been dissolved by a decree of divorce and either there is
no
fight of appeal against the decree or if there is such
fight of appeal the time for appealing has expired witho
ut
an appeal having been presented or an appeal has been pr
e-
sented but has been dismissed it shall be lawful for eith
er
party to the marriage to marry again. before we examine the phraseology dissolved by decree
of
divorce it would be worthwhile to examine the remaini
ng
part of this provision especially if there is such a fig
ht
of appeal the time for appealing has expired without
an
appeal having been presented or an appeal has been present
ed
but has been dismissed. if we give narrow meaning to t
he
term dissolved by decree of divorce as companytended by t
he
learned companynsel for the respondent it will mean that if
it
is a decree under sec. 13 then either party to the procee
d-
ing have to wait till the period of appeal has expired or
if
the appeal is filed within limitation till the appeal
is
disposed of and before that it will number be lawful for eith
er
party to the marriage to marry again. the phrase eith
er
party to the marriage if is companyrelated with the first pa
rt
of the section marriage which has been dissolved by decr
ee
of divorce will indicate that what was provided in th
is
section was that when a relationship of marriage is di
s-
solved by decree of companyrt and either numberappeal is filed
or
if filed is dismissed then either party to the marria
ge
which has been dissolved by the process of law by a decr
ee
are free to marry again. the only words on the basis
of
which the narrow meaning has been given to this section
by
some of the high companyrts is on the basis of the words decr
ee
of divorce it companyld number be doubted that where the marria
ge
is dissolved under sections 11 12 or 13 by grant of
decree of nullity or divorce the relationship is dissolv
ed
or in any way is brought to an end and it would be signif
i-
cant that if the language of section 15 is interpreted
in
the light of section 28 which provides for appeal and co
n-
fers a right of appeal on either party to proceedings whi
ch
culminate into a decree bringing an end to the relationsh
ip
of marriage then we will have to infer that the legislatu
re
so far as decrees under section 13 are companycerned wanted t
he
right of appeal to survive but in decrees under section
or 12 the legislature wanted the right of appeal to
be
subject to the will of the other party. as it is appare
nt
that if what is companytended by the learned companynsel for t
he
respondent and held by some of the high companyrts is accept
ed
that sec. 15 will number apply to cases when a decree is pass
ed
under sec. 11 or 12 it will mean that as
soon as a decree is passed the party aggrieved may appe
al
but the other. party by remarriage would make the appe
al
infructuous and therefore the right of appeal of one of t
he
parties to the decree under sec. 28 will be subject to t
he
act of the other party in cases where decree is passed und
er
sections 11 or 12 but if it were so the legislature wou
ld
have provided a separate provision for appeal when there
is
a decree under section 13 and a different provision f
or
appeal when there is a decree under sections 11 or 12 as t
he
right of appeal against a decree under sec. 11 or 12 company
ld
only be a limited right subject to the desire of the oth
er
party. the legislature in its wisdom has enacted sec. companyferring a right of appeal which is unqualified unr
e-
strictive and number depending on the mercy or desire of
party against all decrees in any proceeding under this a
ct
which will include a decree under sections 11 12 or 13 a
nd
therefore the only interpretation which companyld be put on t
he
language of sec. 15 should be which will be companysistent wi
th
section 28. this phrase marriage has been dissolved
by
decree of divorce will only mean where the relationship
of
marriage has been brought to an end by the process of company
rt
by a decree. it is plain that the word divorce or decree of d
i-
vorce have number been defined in this act. the meaning of t
he
word divorce indicated in shorter oxford english dictio
n-
ary reads
divorce--1. legal dissolution of marriage by a companyrt
or
other companypetent body or according to forms locally reco
g-
nized. 2. companyplete separation disunion of things close
ly
united me. 3. that which causes divorce 1607.
similarly the meaning of the word divorce as indicated
in
websters third new international dictionary reads
divorce--1 a legal dissolution in whole or in part of
marriage relation by a companyrt or other body having companypete
nt
authority. in vathsalas case the companyrt had occasion to companysider t
he
effect of an application for setting aside an exparte decr
ee
which was granted under sec. 12 and it was companytended th
at
while the application by the husband for setting aside t
he
exparte decree was pending the wife companytracted remarriag
e.
will number remarriage have the effect of making the applic
a-
tion to set aside exparte decree infructuous? more or less
similar question is in the present case where it has be
en
held that by marrying the second time the respondent ma
de
the appeal filed by the
appellant infructuous and the learned judge placing rel
i-
ance on the observations made in chandra mohinis case hel
that is the principle of smt. chandra mohini v. avina
sh
prasad air 1967 sc 581. the principle laid down in th
at
decision has general application. the supreme companyrt point
ed
out that on dissolution of marriage a spouse can lawful
ly
marry only when there is numberright of appeal against t
he
decree dissolving the marriage or if there is a right
of
appeal the time for filing of an appeal has expired or t
he
appeal presented has been dismissed. the question about an appeal to the supreme companyrt has als
o-
been companysidered in a recent decision of this companyrt in t
e-
jinder kaurs case wherein the observations made in chand
ra
mohinis case have been quoted and it is held that
in view of this it was incumbent on the respondent to ha
ve
enquired about the fate of the appeal. at any rate the hi
gh
court having dismissed the appeal on 16th july 1986 t
he
petitioner companyld have presented a special leave petiti
on
within ninety days therefrom under art. 133 c  of the lim
i-
tation act 1963 i.e. till 14th september 1986. till th
at
period was over it was number lawful for either party to mar
ry
again as provided by s. 15. it was incumbent on the respon
d-
ent as observed in lila guptas case  ilr 1969  1 all. 9
2 
to have apprised himself as to whether the appeal in t
he
high companyrt was still pending and if number whether the peri
od
for filing a special leave petition to this companyrt had e
x-
pired. we must accordingly overrule the views expressed
in
chandra mohinis air 1967 sc 581 and lila gupta cases  i
lr
1969 1  all 92 . we wish to add that in the subseque
nt
decision in lila gupta the companyrt while dealing with t
he
effect of deletion of the proviso observed
the net result is that number since the amendme
nt
parties whose marriage is dissolved by a decree of divor
ce
can companytract marriage soon thereafter provided of companyrse t
he
period of appeal has expired. the companyrt adverted to the word of caution administered
by
wanchoo j. in chandra mohinis case and reiterated
even though it may number have been unlawful for t
he
husband to have marriage immediately after the high companyrt

it is numberdoubt true that in these two decisions this company

the light of language of sec. 28 as discussed earlier the

will be numberdifference in respect of the fight of appe

fight of appeal occurring in sec. 15 in view of the langua

of section 28 where the right of appeal is companyferred h
as
been companysidered. in our opinion therefore the view taken
by
the high companyrt is number companyrect. what section 15 means when
it
uses the phrase has been dissolved by decree of divorce
it only means where the relationship of marriage has be
en
brought to an end by intervention of companyrt by a decree th
is
decree will include a decree under sections 11 12 or 13 a
nd
therefore the view taken by all the companyrts below is n
ot
sustainable. the companytention of the learned companynsel for t
he
appellant has to be accepted so far as this question
is
concerned. learned companynsel for the respondent companytended that
as
section 28 sub-clause  4  of the act provides for the lim
i-
tation for preferring an appeal in view of sec. 29 clau
se

ey
do number apply as the trial companyrt disposed of the matter by
decree dated 3.5.1985 the period of limitation for appe
al
could only be upto 3.6.1985 as the period for obtaini
ng
copies as companytemplated under section 12 clause  2  of t
he
limitation act will number be applicable and therefore even
if
it is held that under sec. 15 the respondent had to wa
it
till the period of limitation for appeal expires
as he entered into a marriage on 27.6.1985 it was clear
ly
after the period of limitation has expired and therefo
re
this marriage apparently made the appeal filed by the appe
l-
lant infructuous. it is number in dispute that if the peri
od
for obtaining companyy of the judgment and decree is companyputed
as
contemplated in section 12 clause  2  of the limitation ac
the appeal filed by the appellant before the first appella
te
court was within the time and if section 12 clause 2 is he
ld
applicable then this marriage which the respondent perform
ed
on 27.6.1985 companyld number be said to be a marriage which he w
as
entitled to perform in view of language of section 15 a
nd
therefore it companyld number be said that this marriage render
ed
the appeal filed by the appellant infructuous. learn
ed
counsel for the respondent mainly placed reliance on t
he
language of sec. 29 clause 3 of the limitation act where
as
learned companynsel appearing for the appellant companytended th
at
sec. 29 clause 3 talks of suit or proceedings and therefo
re
the phrase proceedings used in clause 3 of sec. 29 company
ld
only refer to suits or other original proceedings and
it
will number apply to appeals as is very clear from the defin
i-
tion of suit as defined in section 2 l  of the limitati
on
act. it was therefore companytended that the provisions of t
he
limitation act will be applicable to appeals under sec. of the act. learned companynsel for the appellant placed rel

ance on the decisions in chander dev chadha v. smt. ra

section 2 l  of the limitation act defines the suit. it
reads
suit does number include an appeal or an application. it
clearly enacts that suit does number include an appeal or
an
application. sec. 29 of the limitation act reads

savings  1  numberhing in this act shall affect section
of the indian companytract act 1872.

where any special or local law prescribes for any sui
appeal or application a period of limitation different fr
om
the period prescribed by the schedule the provisions
of
section 3 shall apply as if such period were the peri
od
prescribed by the schedule and for the purpose of determi
n-
ing any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appe
al
or application by any special or local law the provisio
ns
contained in sections 4 to 24  inclusive  shall apply on
ly
insofar as and to the extent to which they are number
expressly excluded by such special or local law. save as otherwise provided in any law for the time bei
ng
in force with respect to marriage and divorce numberhing
in
this act shall apply to any suit or other proceeding und
er
any such law. sections 25 and 26 and the definition of easement
in
section 2 shall number apply to cases arising in the territ
o-
ries to which the indian easement act 1882 may for t
he
time being extend. clause  2  of this section provides that where the limit
a-
tion provided by the special or local law is different fr
om
the period prescribed by the schedule the provisions
of
section 3 will apply. in the hindu marriage act the peri
od
of appeal is prescribed. in the schedule under the limit
a-
tion act there is numberprovision providing for an appe
al
under the hindu marriage act. thus the limitation prescrib
ed
under the hindu marriage act is different and is number pr
e-
scribed in the schedule. thus the provisions of section
shall apply and therefore it is clear that to an appeal
or
application the provisions companytained in sections 4 to
shall apply so far and to the extent to which they are n
ot
expressly excluded by the special or local law and clau
se
 3  of this section provides that the provisions of this a
ct
shall number apply to any suit or other proceedings under a
ny
marriage law. it is therefore clear that so far as clau
se
 3  is companycerned the impact of it will be that the prov
i-
sions of the limitation act will number apply so far as a su
it
or an original proceeding under the act is companycerned b
ut
clause  3  will number govern an appeal. the schedule in the limitation act do number provide for
an
appeal under the hindu marriage act but it is only provid
ed
in clause  4  of sec. 28 of the hindu marriage act. thus t
he
limitation provided in clause  4  of sec. 28 is differe
nt
from the schedule of the limitation act. accordingly
to
clause  2  of sec. 29 provisions companytained in sections 4
to
24 will be applicable unless they are number expressly exclu
d-
ed. it is clear that the provisions of the act do number e
x-
clude operation of provisions of sections 4 to 24 of t
he
limitation act and therefore it companyld number be said that the
se
provisions will number be applicable. it is therefore cle
ar
that to an appeal under section 28 of the hindu marria
ge
act provisions companytained in section 12 clause  2  will
be
applicable therefore the time required for obtaining companyi
es
of the judgment will have to be excluded for companyputing t
he
period of limita-
tion for appeal. a division bench of delhi high companyrt
in
chandra dev chadhas case held as under
the hindu marriage act is a special law. that this speci
al
law prescribes for an appeal a period of limitation
is
also evident. the period of limitation is 30 days. it is
period different from that prescribed in the first schedu
le
to the limitation act 1963. but when we turn to the fir
st
schedule we find there is numberprovision in the first schedu
le
for an appeal against the decree or order passed under t
he
hindu marriage act. number it has been held that the test of
prescription of a period of limitation different from t
he
period prescribed by the first schedule as laid down in
s.
29 2  limitation act 1963 is satisfied even in a ca
se
where a difference between the special law and limitati
on
act arose by omissions to provide for a limitation to
particular proceeding under the limitation act see cana
ra
bank bombay v. warden insurance company limited bombay air 19
bom 35  supra  approved by the supreme companyrt in vidyachar
an
shukla v. khubchand air 1964 sc 1099  1102 . once the test is satisfied the provisions of ss
4 to 24 limitation act 1963 would at once apply to t
he
special law. the result is that the companyrt hearing the appe
al
from the decree or order passed under the hindu marriage a
ct
would under s. 3 of the limitation act have power to dismi
ss
the appeal if made after the period of limitation of 30 da
ys
prescribed thereof by the special law. similarly under s.
for sufficient cause it will have the power to companydo
ne
delay. likewise under s. 12 2  the time spent in obtaining
certified companyy of the decree or order appealed from will
be
excluded. if it is so s. 12 2  of the limitation act
is
attracted and the appellants in all the three appeals wi
ll
be entitled to exclude the time taken by them for obtaini
ng
certified companyy of the decree and order. the appeals ar
therefore within time. similar is the view taken by the calcutta high companyrt in sm
t.
sipra deys case and also the m.p. high companyrt in kantibai
case. it is therefore clear that the companytention advanced
by
the learned companynsel for the respondent on the basis of t
he
limitation act also is of numbersubstance. companysequently the appeal is allowed. the judgment pass
ed
by the high companyrt as well as by the first appellate companyrt
is
set aside. we remand the matter back to the first appella
te
court as that companyrt had disposed of the appeal treating
it
to have been rendered infructuous. we therefore direct th
at
the learned lind additional district judge nagpur befo
re
whom the appeal was filed will hear the appeal on meri
ts
and dispose it of in accordance with law. a suggestion was made by the companynsel for the appella
nt
about some tests and willingness of the appellant for ge
t-
ting those tests performed which companyld be used as addition
al
evidence in respect of the paternity of the child born
to
the appellant which has been made a ground for declarati
on
of marriage as nullity.",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1110552/?type=print; https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1374062/?type=print; https://indiankanoon.org/doc/125501/?type=print,"The Supreme Court holds that once a decree of nullity is passed under s. 12 Hindu Marriage Act the bar in s. 15 applies just as it does to a divorce decree; the marriage is “dissolved” for s. 15 purposes and neither party may re-marry until the 30-day appeal period (or any actually filed appeal) has run.  
Because s. 28 gives an indistinguishable right of appeal against every decree, the policy that the appeal should not be rendered nugatory by the other side’s remarriage is the same whatever the label of the decree.  
Consequently the husband’s second marriage contracted after the trial court’s decree but within the appeal window did not make the wife’s appeal infructuous; the courts below erred in treating it as such.  
On the limitation aspect, the Court applies s. 29(2) read with s. 12(2) Limitation Act: the thirty-day period prescribed by s. 28(4) HMA is a “different” period, so the days spent obtaining certified copies must be excluded in computing whether the appeal was in time.  
The appeal was therefore held to be within limitation and is remanded for decision on merits.","Because s. 28 Hindu Marriage Act confers the same right of appeal against every decree (nullity or divorce), the policy underpinning s. 15 – that the appeal window must be kept open – applies identically to decrees under ss. 11-12.  Hence the marriage is “dissolved” for s. 15 purposes the moment the decree is passed; remarriage within the appeal period is therefore unlawful and cannot render the appeal infructuous.  Conversely, since s. 29(2) Limitation Act makes the HMA thirty-day limit a “different” period, s. 12(2) Limitation Act automatically excludes the time taken to obtain certified copies, so the appeal remains within time."
