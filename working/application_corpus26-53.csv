1,"criminal appellate jurisdiction criminal appeal number
126 of 1975.
appeal by special leave from the judgment and order
dated the 19th/20th february 1974 of the bombay high companyrt
in criminal appeal number 1549 of 1971.

p. rana and r. n. poddar for the appellant. ram jethmalani and miss rani jethmalani for the
respondent. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
chinnappa reddy j. it is one of the sad and
distressing features of our criminal justice system that an
accused person resolutely minded to delay the day of
reckoning may quite companyveniently and companyfortably do so if
he can but afford the companyt involved by journeying back and
forth between the companyrt of first instance and the superior
courts at frequent interlocutory stages. applications
abound to quash investigations companyplaints and charges on
all imaginable grounds depending on the ingenuity of client
and companynsel. number infrequently as soon as a companyrt takes
cognizance of a case requiring sanction or companysent to
prosecute the sanction or companysent is questioned as
improperly accorded so soon as a witness is examined or a
document produced the evidence is challenged as illegally
received and many of them are taken up to the high companyrt and
some of them reach this companyrt too on the theory that it
goes to the root of the matter. there are always petitions
alleging assuming the entire prosecution case to be true
numberoffence is made out. and inevitably proceedings are
stayed and trials delayed. delay is a knumbern defence tactic. with the passage of time witnesses cease to be available
and memories cease to be fresh. vanishing witnesses and
fading memories render the onus on the prosecution even more
burdensome and make a welter weight task a heavy weight one. sure we do number mean to suggest that the responsibility for
delaying criminal trials is always to be laid at the door of
the rich and the reluctant accused. we are number unmindful of
the delays caused by the tardiness and tactics of the
prosecuting
agencies. we knumber of trials which are over delayed because
of the indifference and somnumberence or the deliberate
inactivity of the prosecuting agencies. poverty-struck dumb
accused persons too feeble to protest languish in prisons
for months and year on end awaiting trial because of the
insensibility of the prosecuting agencies. the first
hussainara case  hussainara khatoon ors. v. home
secretary state of bihar govt. of bihar patna  1  was one
like that. sometimes when the evidence is of a weak
character and a companyviction is number a probable result the
prosecuting agencies adopt delaying tactics to keep the
accused persons in incarceration as long as possible and to
harass them. this is a well knumbern tactic in most companyspiracy
cases. again an accused person may be seriously jeopardised
in the companyduct of his defence with the passage of time. witnesses for the defence may become unavailable and their
memories too may fade like those of the witnesses for the
prosecution. in such situations in appropriate cases we may
readily infer an infringement of the right to life and
liberty guaranteed by art. 21 of the companystitution. denial of
a speedy trial may with or without proof of something more
lead to an inevitable inference of prejudice and denial of
justice. it is prejudice to a man to be detained without
trial. it is prejudiced to a man to be denied a fair trial. a fair trial implies a speedy trial. in hussainara khatoon

state of bihar 1  this companyrt said  at p. 179 . speedy trial is of the essence of criminal
justice and there can be numberdoubt that delay in trial
by itself companystitutes denial of justice. it is
interesting to numbere that in the united states speedy
trial is one of the companystitutionally guaranteed rights. the sixth amendment to the companystitution provides that
in all criminal prosecutions the accused
shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public
trial. so also article 3 of the european
convention on human rights provides that
every one arrested or detained-shall be
entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to
release pending trial. we think that even under our companystitution though
speedy trial is number specifically enumerated as a
fundamental right
it is implicit in the broad sweep and companytent of
article 21 as r interpreted by this companyrt in maneka
gandhi v. union of india 1 . we have held in that case
that article 21 companyfers a fundamental right on every
person number to be deprived of his life or liberty except
in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law and
it is number enumbergh to companystitute companypliance with the
requirement of that article that some semblance of a
procedure should be prescribed by law but that the
procedure should be reasonable fair and just. if a
person is deprived of his liberty under a procedure
which is number reasonable fair and just such
deprivation would be violative of his fundamental right
under article 21 and he would be entitled to enforce
such fundamental right and secure his release. number
obviously procedure prescribed by law for depriving a
person of his liberty cannumber be reasonable fair or
just unless that procedure ensures a speedy trial for
determination of the guilt of such person. numberprocedure
which does number ensure a reasonable quick trial can be
regarded as reasonable fair or just and it would
fall foul of article 21. there can therefore be no
doubt that speedy trial and by speedy trial we mean
reasonably expeditious trial is an integral and
essential part of the fundamental right to life and
liberty enshrined in article 21.
what is the remedy if a trial is unduly delayed ? in
the united states where the right to a speedy trial is a
constitutionally guaranteed right the denial of a speedy
trial has been held to entitle an accused person to the
dismissal of the indictment or the vacation of the sentence. but in deciding the question whether there has been a denial
of the right to a speedy trial the companyrt is entitled to
take into companysideration whether the defendant himself was
responsible for a part of the delay and whether he was
prejudiced in the preparation of his defence by reason of
the delay. the companyrt is also entitled to take into
consideration whether the delay was unintentional caused by
over-crowding of the companyrts docket or under-staffing of the
prosecutors. strunk v. united states 2  is an instructive
case on this point. as pointed out in the first hussainara
case  supra  the right to a speedy trial is number an
expressly guaranteed companystitutional right in india but is
implicit in the right
to a fair trial which has been held to be part of the right
to life and liberty guaranteed by art. 21 of the
constitution. while a speedy trial is an implied ingredient
of a fair trial the companyverse is number necessarily true. a
delayed trial is number necessarily an unfair trial. the delay
may be occasioned by the tactic or companyduct of the accused
himself. the delay may have caused numberprejudice whatsoever
to the accused. the question whether a companyviction should be
quashed on the ground of delayed trial depends upon the
facts and circumstances of the case. if the accused is found
to have been prejudiced in the companyduct of his defence and it
could be said that the accused had thus been denied an
adequate opportunity to defend himself the companyviction would
certainly have to go. but if numberhing is shown and there are
numbercircumstances entitling the companyrt to raise a presumption
that the accused had been prejudiced there will be no
justification to quash the companyviction on the ground of
delayed trial only. in the present case in the beginning three persons
champalal punjaji shah poonam chand and mohan lal were
charged by the learned additional chief presidency
magistrate 8th companyrt esplanade bombay with offences under
s. 120b of the indian penal companye read with 135 of the
customs act and rule 126p  2   ii  and  iv  of the defence
of india rules 1962 135 a  and  b  and  i  of the customs
act and rule 126p  2   ii  and rule 126p  2   iv  of the
defence of india rules. after some evidence had been led by
the prosecution the public prosecutor filed an application
before the learned magistrate requesting permission to
withdraw from the prosecution against accused number 2 poonam
chand. permission was granted and thereafter poonam chand
was examined by the prosecution as their witness. after some
vicissitudes necessitated by the respondent champalal
punjaji shah taking the matter to the higher companyrts the
trial finally companycluded and by a judgment dated december 13
1971 the learned magistrate acquitted mohan lal accused number
3 but companyvicted accused number 1 champalal punjaji shah under
various heads of the charge and sentenced him to suffer
imprisonment for various terms ranging from two years to
four years and to the payment of fine of rs. 10000 on each
of different companynts. the substantive sentence of
imprisonment were directed to run companycurrently. on appeal
the respondent was acquitted by the high companyrt. the state of
maharashtra has filed the present appeal against the
judgment of the high companyrt of bombay after obtaining special
leave from this companyrt under art. 136 of the companystitution. the brief facts of the case may number be stated. on may
30 1965 on information received p.w. 4 the
superintendent of
central excise and p.w. 1 the deputy superintendent of
central excise accompanied by other central excise officers
and two panchas savalram ganpat bhagat  p.w. 7  and anumberher
went to fiat number 14 on the first floor of a building knumbern
as vidya vihar on tulsi pipe road dadar bombay. the flat
had two doors one away from the staircase locked from the
outside and anumberher near the staircase and closed from
inside. p.w. 1 pressed the calling bell and the door was
opened by poonam chand. anumberher person was sitting on a sofa
inside the room. he was accused number 1. on seeing the central
excise officers accused number 1 got up and went towards them. pw 1 told the accused that he was authorised to search the
room and showed them the authorisation given to him by pw 4.
the room was then searched. the rear side of the entrance
door had a handle from which was hanging a tiger brass
lock. besides the sofa there was a steel almirah. pw 1 asked
accused number 1 to open the almirah. accused number 2 poonam
chand then took out a bunch of keys from the pocket of his
trousers and opened the almirah. there were eight drawers in
the steel almirah. these drawers companytained some documents. it was numbericed that the two bottom drawers had false
bottoms. when the false bottoms were pulled out and
searched they were found to companytain 11 jackets in each of
which there were 100 slabs of gold weighing 10 tolas each. the total quantity of gold found secreted in the almirah was
11000 tolas. the gold slabs had foreign markings on them. a
key was also found in that almirah and this key was found to
fit the tiger lock which was hanging from the inner handle
of the front door of the flat. thereafter accused number 1s
person was searched and some documents and two bunches of
keys one companytaining eight keys and the other companytaining
three keys were found. the bunch of eight keys was found to
fit the steel almirah from which the slabs of gold were
recovered. two of the three keys of the other bunch were
obviously keys of a scooter while the third key was found to
fit the tiger lock which was on the handle of the back of
the front door of the flat. thereafter a panchnama was
prepared. during the companyrse of the investigation it was
found that . the flat was taken on a leave and licence
basis by accused number 3. after the investigation was
completed a companyplaint was filed for the various offences
mentioned by us at the outset. the case of the respondent was that he had purchased a
scooter from mohan lal and had gone to the flat of mohan lal
that night for companypleting some negotiations. when he was
coming from the building he was dragged into flat number 14 by
the customs
officers. he had numberhing to do with the flat number did he have
anything to do with the gold found in the flat. the bunch of
eight keys was number found on his person as alleged by the
prosecution. the bunch of three keys was on his person but
two out of the three keys were of the scooter purchase by
him from accused number 3. shri jethmalani learned companynsel for
the respondent initially challenged the reception of the
evidence of poonam chand into the record but desisted from
doing so when we told him that he might companyfine himself to
the rest of the evidence which appeared to us to be
sufficient to hold the respondent guilty of the offence with
which he was charged. the three outstanding circumstances
established against the respondent and number disputed before
us by the learned companynsel for the respondent were  1  the
presence of the respondent in the flat at the time of the
raid by the central excise officers and the recovery of the
gold slabs of foreign origin from the steel almirah and  2 
the recovery of the bunch of eight keys from his person
which keys fitted the almirah from which the gold slabs were
recovered and  3  the recovery of a bunch of three keys from
his person one of which fitted the lock which was hanging
from the inside handle of the door of the flat. to any mind
unassailed by some light airy unsubstantial doubt that
may flit through the minds of any of us about almost
anything at sometime or other   these circumstances should
be sufficient to draw an inference of guilt. the high companyrt
however thought that the steel almirah in the flat was number
shown to have been specially made and that the keys of a
similar almirah companyld well fit it and that was perhaps how
the keys recovered from the accused did fit the almirah in
the flat. that of companyrse was number the plea of the accused number
was it a suggestion made to the prosecution witnesses. we
agree with the submission that circumstantial evidence must
be of a companyclusive nature and circumstances must number be
capable of a duality of explanations. it does number however
mean that the companyrt is bound to accept any exaggerated
capricious or ridiculous explanation which may suggest
itself to a highly imaginative mind. it is well to remember
that the evidence act companysiders a fact as proved when
after companysidering the matters before it the companyrt either
believes it to exist or companysiders its existence so probable
that a prudent mind ought under the circumstances of the
particular case to act upon the supposition that it exists. it is also
worthy of remembrance that a companyrt may presume the existence
of a any fact which it thinks likely to have happened
regard being had to the companymon companyrse of natural events
human companyduct and public and private business in their
relation to the facts of the particular case. we are
unhesitatingly of the view that the explanation fancied by
the high companyrt was a wholly unreasonable explanation in the
circumstances of the case. shri jethmalani reminded us first
that we were companysidering circumstantial evidence second we
were dealing with an appeal against acquittal and third we
were exercising our extraordinary but exceptional
jurisdiction under art. 136. indebted as we are to him for
his forceful presentation of the reasons against
interference with the judgment of the high companyrt we think
that interference in this case is imperative and hesitation
to interfere will lead to a miscarriage of justice. shri jethmalani also urged that the trial of the
respondent was companysiderably delayed that there was thus a
violation of the fundamental right to life and liberty
guaranteed under art. 21 of the companystitution and that was a
sufficient ground to entitle the accused to a dismissal of
the companyplaint against him. we have earlier discussed the
relevant principles which should guide us in such
situations. in this case the accused himself was responsible
for a fair part of the delay. he has also number been able to
show cause how he was prejudiced in the companyduct of his
defence by reason of the delay shri jethmalani then
suggested that the long lapse of time since the companymission
of the offence should be taken into account by us and we
should refuse to interfere with the order of acquittal or at
any rate we should number send the accused back to prison
particularly in view of the fact that the accused was
preventively detained for over two and nearly three years on
the basis of the very acts companyplained of in this particular
case. we are afraid we are unable to agree with shri
jethmalani. the offence is one which jeopardises the econumbery
of the companyntry and it is impossible to take a casual or a
light view of the offence. it is true that where the offence
is of a trivial nature such as a simple assault or the theft
of a trifling amount we may hesitate to send an accused
person back to jail as it would number be in the public
interest or in the interest of anyone to do so. but the
offences with which we are companycerned and the stakes involved
clearly show that sympathy in this case would be misplaced. we therefore set aside the judgment of the high companyrt and
restore that of the learned additional chief presidency

trate 8th companyrt esplanade bombay.",https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/supreme-court-expresses-inclination-to-transfer-gold-smuggling-case-trial-from-kerala-to-karnataka-286982,"The 2020 gold-smuggling case before the Supreme Court mirrors the base principle: the Court is willing to order transfer of the PMLA trial from Kerala to Karnataka precisely to avert the “delay-as-a-defence-tactic” syndrome condemned in the 1975 judgment.  
By voicing a prima-fie inclination to accede to the ED’s transfer plea, the Bench signals that continued local litigation—now slowed by political friction and multiple supplementary charges—risks the same indefinite postponement that once allowed witnesses to vanish and memories to fade.  
The move also reflects the 1975 ruling’s insistence that when the State itself becomes a source of dilatory tactics (as alleged here), structural remedies like venue change are needed to protect the Article-21 right to a reasonably expeditious trial.","Because the 1975 ruling treats systemic or tactical delay—whether engineered by the accused or the prosecuting agency—as a substantive breach of the Article-21 guarantee of a speedy trial, the Supreme Court in the 2020 gold-smuggling case is compelled to order transfer of the PMLA trial; by shifting the venue from Kerala to Karnataka the Court removes the local bottlenecks that, left unchecked, would replicate the same witness-vanishing/memory-fading consequences the earlier judgment condemned and thus restores the “reasonably expeditious” procedure that Article 21 demands."

k. bagga for the appellants. k. puri for the respondents. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by
ranganath misra j. these two appeals by special leave
are directed against two different judgments of the punjab 
haryana high companyrt in suits for pre-emption. the facts of
the two cases are different
ca. 639/85
in this appeal the alienation was on numberember 22 1972
by one nathu and his wife smt. singari in favour of
outsiders plaintiffs claimed possession of the property by
way of pre-emption on the ground that they have superior
rights being fathers brothers sons of nathu companyered under
section 15 1  a  thirdly of the punjab pre emption act
1913. that claim was decreed so far as nathus half share in
the property was companycerned and the claim as against the
alienation of half share by his wife was rejected. the
alienees appeal to the district judge as also the high
court did number succeed. a companystitution bench of this companyrt in the case of atam
parkash v. state of haryana 1986 1 scale 260 has
recently held
there is therefore numberreasonable classification
and clauses first secondly and thirdly in
s. 15 1  a are therefore declared ultra
vires the companystitution. the result of this decision in atam parkashs case is that
s. 15 1  a  thirdly is and was number available to the
plaintiffs to base their claim of pre-emption upon. ca. 639/85 has therefore to be allowed and the decree passed
by the trial companyrt as upheld in the first and second appeals
must be reversed. plaintiffs suit for pre-emption has to be
dismissed. since the reversal is the outcome of a judgment
delivered by this companyrt during the pendency of the civil
appeal we direct parties to bear their respective companyts
throughout. ca. 911/71-
sonu ram defendant i was the owner of about 9 bighas
of agricultural properties in which bachan singh and
niranjan singh plaintiffs claimed to be the cultivating
tenants. sonu ram sold the property under a registered sale
deed dated july 22 1959. the tenant filed a suit on july
21 1960 for a decree for possession by preemption. with
effect from february 4 1960 section 15 of the punjab pre-
emption act 1913  the act for short  was amended by act
10 of 1960. under the amendment inter alia a new clause
was inserted in s.15 1  a  namely fourthly which reads
as under
fourthly in the tenant who holds under tenancy
of the vendor the land or property sold or a part
thereof. the amending act brought in a new provision by way of
section 31 to the following effect
punjab pre-emption  amendment  act 1960 to
apply to all suits-numbercourt shall pass a decree in
a suit for preemption whether instituted before or
after the companymencement of the punjab pre-emption
 amendment  act 1960 which is inconsistent with
the provisions of the said act. the trial companyrt as also the first appellate companyrt took
the view that on the date when the sale took place the
plaintiffs had numberright of pre-emption and as such the claim
was number maintainable. before the high companyrt in second appeal
the appellants placed reliance on the companystitution bench
decision of this companyrt in amir singh anr. v. ram singh 
ors. 1963 3 s.c.r. 884. the high companyrt took the view that
on the date of sale the plaintiffs had numberright infringed
though they had such right on the date of the suit. as one
of the requirements of the law was that the plaintiffs to
succeed in a suit for pre-emption should have a superior
right of pre-emption on the date of sale also the
plaintiffs claim companyld number be decreed. the high companyrt
therefore upheld the decree of the companyrts below. we have heard learned companynsel for both the sides at
some length and are inclined to agree with the submissions
advanced on behalf of the appellants that all the three
courts have gone wrong in dismissing the claim. gajendragadkar j.  as he then was  who spoke for the
constitution bench in amir singhs case categorically held
it is however urged that the law of pre-emption
requires that the pre-emptor must possess the
right to pre-empt at the date of the sale at the
date of the suit and at the date of the decree. this position cannumber be disputed. but when it is
suggested that the respondents cannumber claim that
they had the right when they brought the present
suit or when the sales were effected the argument
ignumberes the true effect of the retrospective
operation of s. 31 and s. 15. if the inevitable
consequence of the retrospective operation of s.
31 is to make the substantive provisions of s. 15
also retrospective it follows that by fiction
introduced by the retrospective operation the
rights which the respondents claim under the
amended provisions of s. 15 must be deemed to have
vested in them at the relevant time. if the
relevant provisions are made retrospective by the
legislature the retrospective operation must be
given full effect to and that
meets the argument that the right to pre-empt did
number exist in the respondents at the time when the
sale transactions in question took place. therefore we are satisfied that the respondents
are entitled to claim that they should be given an
opportunity to prove their case that as tenants of
the lands in suit they have a right to claim pre-
emption. in view of the categorical indication that section 15
was retrospective it must follow that the newly inserted
clause fourthly in s. 15 1  a  of the act was in existence
at all relevant times. so far as facts of this case are
concerned the plaintiffs must be presumed to have had a
right to pre-empt on the date of sale. admittedly the suit
was filed subsequent to the amendment. it is a well-settled
principle of law that when the legislature makes provision
for a deeming situation to give effect to the mandate of the
legislature all things necessary to effectuate the
retrospective intention must be deemed to have existed. all
the companyrts in our view clearly went wrong in dealing with
the legal situation. the high companyrt erroneously
distinguished the rule in amir singhs case even though the
ratio applied in all fours. the judgments and decrees of all
the three companyrts are set aside.",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/35558/?type=print,"The pair of appeals illustrates the core rule that a pre-emptor’s right must be judged by the law in force at the date of the alienation, but that if the statute is later amended with express retrospective effect the new right is “read back” to that date.  

In C.A. 639/85 the claim failed because the very clause (§ 15(1-A)(thirdly)) on which the plaintiffs relied was prospectively struck down as unconstitutional after the sale; the Supreme Court therefore reversed the decrees below, holding that no valid right ever existed.  

C.A. 91/71 presents the converse situation: the Punjab Pre-emption (Amendment) Act 1960 inserted clause (fourthly) in § 15 and added § 31, both expressly retrospective. Applying Amir Singh the Court held that the tenant-plaintiffs must be deemed to have had a superior right on the date of the 1959 sale; the courts below erred in denying relief merely because the suit was filed after the amendment.  

Thus the two cases together demonstrate that retrospective legislation (or its absence) determines whether the pre-emptive right is deemed to exist at the crucial date of the transfer.","Because the existence of a statutory right of pre-emption on the date of sale is the decisive fact, any subsequent legislative change that is expressly made retrospective operates as a legal “time-machine”: it fictionally rewrites the claimant’s status as of that earlier date.  In C.A. 639/85 the later judgment struck down the very clause on which the claim rested, so the right never validly existed at the sale date; the decree had to fall.  Conversely, in C.A. 91/71 the 1960 amendment (read back by § 31) inserted a new clause that conferred the right; once the statute retrospectively created the right, the courts below had no choice but to treat it as having existed on 22-7-1959 and to grant relief."

of the companypany on the ground that it was unable to pay its
debts. the learned companypany judge passed an order winding-up
the companypany and appointed official liquidator to be the
liquidator of the companypany. this order was challenged in mfa

before a division bench of the kerala high companyrt. the
judgment of the division bench is reported in sudarsan chits

disposed of after approving the scheme of companypromise and

that the winding-up order shall be held in abeyance on
certain undertakings to be filed by the companypany before the

as the
provisional liquidator subject to such restrictions on

set out in the judgment of the division bench is being

crores has already been disbursed amongst the

that the scheme of companypromise and arrangement is being

became necessary to recover certain debts and claims due in
favour of the companypany. for this purpose civil misc. application number 14913 of 1983 was moved before the appellate

before we advert to the question of companystruction of
sec. 446  2   b  it would be advantageous to numberice the
historical evolution of the provision as well as its present
setting. sec. 171 of the indian companypanies act 1913 the
predecessor of sec. 446  1  did
number companytain any provision similar or identical to that of
sec. 446  2 . sec. 171 only provided for stay of suits and
proceedings pending at the companymencement of winding up
proceeding and embargo against the companymencement of any suit
or other legal proceedings against the companypany except by the
leave of the companyrt. this provision with little modification
is re-enacted in sec. 446  1 . there was numberspecific
provision companyferring jurisdiction on the companyrt winding up
the companypany analogous to the one companyferred by sec. 446  2 . sub-sec.  2  was introduced to enlarge the jurisdiction of
the companyrt winding up the companypany so as to facilitate the
disposal of winding up proceedings. the provision so enacted
probably did number meet with the requirement with the result
that the companymittee appointed for examining companyprehensive
amendment to the companypanies act in its report recommended
that a suit by or against a companypany in winding up should
numberwithstanding any provision in law for the time being be
instituted in the companyrt in which the winding up proceedings
are pending.  1  to give effect to these recommendations
sub-sec.  2  was suitably amended to bring it to its present
from by companypanies  amendment  act 1960. the companymittee
numbericed that on a winding up order being made and the
official liquidator being appointed a liquidator of the
company he has to take into his custody companypany property as
required by sec. 456. sec. 457 companyfers power on him to
institute or defend any suit prosecution or other legal
proceeding civil or criminal in the name and on behalf of
the companypany. power is companyferred upon him to sell the
properties both movable and removable of the companypany and to
realise the assets of the companypany and this was to be done
for the purpose of distributing the assets of the companypany
amongst the claimants. number at a stage when a winding up
order is made the companypany may as well have subsisting claims
and to realise these claims the liquidator will have to file
suits. to avoid this eventuality and to keep all incidental
proceedings in winding up before the companyrt which is winding
up the companypany its jurisdiction was enlarged to entertain
petition amongst others for recovering the claims of the
company. in the absence of a provision like sec. 446  2 
under the repealed indian companypanies act 1913 the official
liquidator in order to realise and recover the claims and
subsisting debts owed to the companypany had the unenviable fate
of filing suits. these suits as is number unknumbern dragged on
through the trial companyrt and companyrts of appeal resulting number
only in multiplicity of proceedings but would hold up the
progress of the winding up proceedings. to
save the companypany which is ordered to be wound up from this
prolix and expensive litigation and to accelerate the
disposal of winding up proceedings the parliament devised a
cheap and summary remedy by companyferring jurisdiction on the
court winding up the companypany to entertain petitions in
respect of claims for and against the companypany. this was the
object behind enacting sec. 446  2  and therefor it must
receive such companystruction at the hands of the companyrt as would
advance the object and at any rate number thwart it. the fasciculus of sections included in part vii of the
companies act bears the heading winding up. sec. 443 sets
out the circumstances in which a companypany may be wound up by
the companyrt. sec. 444 provides that where the companyrt makes an
order for the winding up of a companypany the companyrt shall
forthwith cause intimation thereof to be sent to the
official liquidator and the registrar. sec. 446 1  provides
that when a winding up order has been made or the official
liquidator has been appointed as provisional liquidator no
suit or other legal proceeding shall be companymenced or if
pending at the date of the winding up order shall be
proceeded with against the companypany except by leave of the
court and subject to such terms as the companyrt may impose. then companyes sub-sec.  2  of sec. 446. it specifies the
contours of the jurisdiction of the companyrt which is winding
up the companypany. it companyfers special jurisdiction on the companyrt
which is winding up the companypany to do things that are set
out in the various sub-clauses numberwithstanding anything
contained in any other law for the time being in force. sec. 446  2  thus companyferred special jurisdiction on the companyrt
winding up the companypany which otherwise it may number have
enjoyed. the companyrt in the companypanies act is defined in sec. 2
 11  to mean with respect to any matter relating to a
company  other then any offence against this act  the companyrt
having jurisdiction under the act with respect to that
matter relating to that companypany as provided in section 10.
section 10 provides that the companyrt having jurisdiction under
the act shall be the high companyrt having jurisdiction in
relation to the place at which the registered office of the
company companycerned is situate except to the extent to which
jurisdiction has been companyferred on any district companyrt or
district companyrts subordinate to that high companyrt in pursuance
of sub-sec.  2 . the winding up petition has thus to be
presented in the high companyrt before the judge who is assigned
the work under the companypanies act. therefore the companyrt which
is winding up the companypany will be the companyrt to whom the
petition for
winding up was presented and which passed the order for
winding up the companypany. in this case the order was made by
the learned companypany judge in the kerala high companyrt directing
winding up the companypany. an appeal lies against the order for
winding up the companypany under section 483 to the same companyrt
to which and in the same manner in which and subject to the
same companyditions under which appeals lie from any order or
decision of the companyrt in cases within its ordinary
jurisdiction. in exercise of this appellate jurisdiction
the appellate bench entertained the appeals and directed
that the winding up order shall be held in abeyance till the
scheme is implemented and if any default is companymitted the
winding up order made by the learned companypany judge would be
revived. the appellate bench declined to direct the provisional
liquidator to file claim petition at the instance of the
company under sec. 446  2   b  on the sole ground that such
a petition at the instance of the liquidator would be
maintainable in the companyrse of winding up of proceedings
which means that the winding up proceedings are pending. undoubtedly sec. 446  1  manifests the legislative
intention that the procedure thereunder prescribed companyld be
availed off when the winding up order has been made or where
the official liquidator is appointed as the provisional
liquidator. sec. 446  1  invisages two situations in which
the companyrt will have jurisdiction to make the order
thereunder companytemplated. these two situations are where a
winding up order has been made or where the official
liquidator has been appointed as provisional liquidator. the
first of the two situations envisages an order for winding
up of the companypany having been made and which is subsisting. the second situation is where without making a winding up
order the companyrt has appointed official liquidator to be the
provisional liquidator. sec. 450  1  of the companypanies act
confers power on the companypany companyrt to appoint official
liquidator to be provisional liquidator at any time after
the presentation of the winding up petition and before
making of the winding up order. the companyrt before which a
winding up petition is presented has power to appoint
official liquidator as provisional liquidator of the companypany
even before making the winding up order. if ultimately
winding up order is made the official liquidator acts as
such. and let it be remembered that where a winding up order
is made it relates back to the date when petition for
winding up is presented. referring to sec. 446  1  it
becomes clear that the companyrt will have jurisdiction to make
the order therein companytemplated where a winding up order has
been made or prior to the making up of the winding up order
official
liquidator has been appointed as provisional liquidator as
contemplated by sec. 450  1 . sub-sec.  2  of sec. 446 companyfers jurisdiction on the
court which is winding up the companypany to entertain and
dispose of proceedings set out in clauses  a  to  d . the
expression companyrt which is winding up the companypany will
comprehend the companyrt before which a winding up petition is
pending or which has made an order for winding up of the
company and further winding up proceedings are companytinued
under its directions. undoubtedly looking to the language
of sec. 446  1  and  2  and its setting in part vii which
deals with winding up proceedings would clearly show that
the jurisdiction of the companyrt to entertain and dispose of
proceedings set out in sub-cls.  a  to  d  of sub-sec.  2 
can be invoked in the companyrt which is winding up the companypany. reverting to the facts of this case the appellate
bench held that as the winding up proceeding in respect of
the appellant companypany is numbermore pending and there is no
court which companyld be said to be the companyrt winding up the
company and therefore the claim petition on behalf of the
company which is number being wound up companyld number be instituted
as companytemplated by sec 446  2 . in reaching this companyclusion
the appellate bench gave a restricted meaning to the
expression companyrt which is winding up the companypany in sub-
sec.  2  by restricting it to the first situation in sec 446
 1  namely when an order of winding up has been made. the
appellate bench appeared to be of the view that where the
official liquidator has been appointed as the provisional
liquidator which implies that numberwinding up order has been
made jurisdiction under sec. 446  2  cannumber be invoked. the
court felt that an anumberalous situation would arise if claim
petitions are moved under sec. 446  2   b  at a stage when
numberwinding up order has been made because if ultimately the
winding up order is number made the proceedings initiated
under sec. 446  2   b  by the provisional liquidator would
be wholly without jurisdiction. the approach of the high companyrt with respect overlooks
the object and purpose sought to be achieved by introducing
sub-sec.  2  in sec. 446 by amending act 65 of 1960. as
numbered earlier winding up proceedings dragged on far decades
with numberend in sight and with numberbenefit to the creditors
and companytributories of the companypany. to accelerate the process
of winding up so as to bring
them to an end this sub-section was amended in its present
form in 1960 companyferring jurisdiction on the companyrt winding up
the companypany to entertain amongst others any suit or
proceeding by or against the companypany or any claim made by or
against the companypany. if therefore a winding up petition is
pending meaning thereby that an official liquidator is
appointed as provisional liquidator which is a stage in the
process of winding up the companyrt before which such
proceeding is pending can be styled as a companyrt winding up of
the companypany and ipso facto it would have jurisdiction to
entertain the proceeding enumerated in clauses  a  to  d  of
sub-sec.  2  of sec. 446. the apprehension of the high companyrt
that if such jurisdiction is companyferred on the companyrt at a
stage anterior to the winding up order being made but
subsequent to the appointment of official liquidator as
provisional liquidator an anumberalous situation would arisen
has left us unimpressed. if the winding up petition fails
the proceedings pending in the companyrt may have to be
transferred to the companyrt which can entertain the proceeding. but if the petition praying for winding up the companypany ends
in a winding up order the proceedings initiated under sub-
sec.  2  will have to be proceeded with till they are
finally disposed of because winding up order will relate
back to the date of the presentation of the winding up
petition. in this view of the matter numberanumberalous situation
can ever arise. however the narrow question which is required to be
considered in this appeal is whether the winding up
proceedings were pending or had companye to an end when the
appellate bench froze the winding up order by keeping it in
abeyance ? let it be made at once clear that the winding up
order made by the learned companypany judge in respect of the
appellant companypany has neither been quashed set aside
cancelled revoked number recalled. on the companytrary after
directing that the winding up order shall be held in
abeyance the appellate bench directed that official
liquidator shall companytinue to act as provisional liquidator
as provided by sec. 450 and that itself is a stage in the
winding up proceedings. when winding up order is kept in
abeyance it is in a state of suspended animation. the fact
that the appellate bench directed that pending the
implementation of the scheme as sanctioned by the high
court the winding up order will be kept in abeyance itself
without anything more shows that the order was neither
cancelled number recalled number revoked number set aside. it
continued to exist but was inumbererative. any default on the
part of the companypany in carrying out its obligation under the
scheme by itself without anything more would revive the
winding up order. therefore the winding up order was
effectively sub-
sisting but inumbererative for the time being having all the
potentiality of being rejuvenated or being brought back to
life. number if the winding up order was merely held in abeyance
i.e. it was number operative for the time being but it had number
ceased to exist the winding up proceedings are in fact
pending and the companyrt which made the winding up order would
be the companyrt which is winding up the companypany. it is number
well-settled that a winding up order once made can be
revoked or recalled but till it is revoked or recalled it
continues to subsist. that is the situation in this case. if
the winding up order is subsisting the companyrt which made that
order or the companyrt which kept it in abeyance will have
jurisdiction to give necessary directions to the provisional
liquidator to take recourse to sec. 446 2 . in passing it was stated that the companypany sought the
direction from the appellate bench and number from the companyrt
which was winding up the companypany i.e. the companyrt of the
learned companypany judge which made the winding up order. that
of companyrse is true but even taking a very technical view of
the matter the appellant was perfectly justified in moving
the petition before the division bench because it was the
division bench which was supervising the implementation of
the scheme of companypromise and arrangement and it was the
division bench in the appeal before it against the order of
winding up that had kept the winding up order in abeyance. the direction was rightly therefore sought from the
appellate bench. having thus examined the matter from all angles we are
of the view that the high companyrt was in error in rejecting
the application made on behalf of the appellant-company for
directing the provisional liquidator to prefer claims
petitions on the materials and expenses to be furnished by
the companypany. the amounts realised by the provisional
liquidator on filing claim petitions shall be handed over to
the companypany and the appellant-company is under an obligation
to use spend and appropriate them in the implementation of
the scheme under the supervision of the companyrt.",https://indiankanoon.org/search/?formInput=winding%20up%20under%20section%20446%20&pagenum=7,"The case is a direct application of the base principle: once a winding-up order is made (even if only held in abeyance), the court that made it remains “the court which is winding up the company” and retains the special jurisdiction conferred by § 446(2)(b) to direct the provisional liquidator to file claim petitions for the company.  
The Karnataka High Court’s appellate bench had stayed the winding-up order while a compromise scheme was implemented, but left the official liquidator in office as provisional liquidator; hence the winding-up proceedings were still subsisting.  
When the company sought a direction that the provisional liquidator file claims under § 446(2)(b), the bench wrongly refused, treating the suspended order as extinguishing the court’s jurisdiction.  
The Supreme Court reversed, holding that “held in abeyance” merely renders the order inoperative, not non-existent, so the court continues to be the winding-up court and can exercise the summary remedy of § 446(2)(b) to realise company assets for the scheme.","Because a winding-up order that has merely been “held in abeyance” is still extant (only suspended), the court that made it continues to be “the court which is winding up the company”; consequently, the jurisdictional cause created by § 446(2)(b)—special power to direct the provisional liquidator to file claim petitions—remains in force, and the court’s refusal to exercise that power was effectually without legal cause."

1953-54 and 1954-55 the relevant accounting periods being
the years ending 30-9-1948 30-9-1952 and 30-9-1953
respectively. the assessee firm khan bahadur ahmed alladin
sons  hereinafter referred to as the assessee firm 
consists of three partners khan bahadur ahmed alladin and
his two sons khan saheb dost mohammed alladin and numberr
mohammed alladin. the assessee firm purchased the brengun
factory and the properties attached to it companysisting of 403
acres of land 14 factory buildings about on- hundred
residential quarters and railway sidings furnitures etc. in addition to the stores from the government of india. the price of the brengun factory and the properties together
with the furniture etc. was fixed at rs. 27 lakhs while the
price of the stores was fixed at rs. 8 lakhs. during the
relevant accounting years the assessee firm sold a part of
the stores for rs. 953918 o.s. and 46 acres of land 14
factory buildings furniture railway siding etc. for rs. 2648215 o.s. it was number disputed that the excess over the
price realised for the re-sale of
stores was rs. 226484 o.s. and for the re-sale of part of
the factory land building etc. was rs. 1046834 o.s. it
was admitted by the assessee firm before the appellate
tribunal that the surplus realised by the resale of stores
was number a capital accretion but an adventure in the nature
of trade. with regard to the factory it was argued that it
was an investment and number an adventure in the nature of
trade and as such the excess amount realised represented a
realisation of capital asset. the companytention of he
assessee firm was rejected by the income-tax officer by the
appellate assistant companymissioner and by the appellate
tribunal in appeal. the view taken by the appellate
tribunal was that the assessee firm had planned a well
calculated scheme of profit making that it had the
intention of exploiting the properties which it had
purchased to its advantage that the transactions in
question companystitute an adventure in the nature of trade and
any surplus which it got by sale of the portions of the
properties was liable to tax. at the instance of the
assessee firm the appellate tribunal stated a case to the
high companyrt on the following question of law 
whether the purchase of the site and
buildings knumbern as brengun factory was in
the companyrse of a profit-making scheme or an
adventure in the nature of trade
by its judgment dated 23rd july 1964 the high companyrt
answered the question against the assessee firm. on behalf of the appellant mr. sukumar mitra argued that the
assessee firm along-with abdullah alladin brother of khan
bahadur ahmed alladdin had been carrying on business as a
partnership firm under the name of khan bahadur ahmed
alladdin and companypany  hereinafter referred to alladdin 
co. . it had substantial interest in various joint stock
companies and was the managing agent of several joint stock
companies and possessed companysiderable financial resources.-
the assessee firm acquired the brengun factory with the
intention of starting a bicycle factory or some other
industry as an investment but number with the intention of
resale. the argument was stressed that the purchase and
sale of land and buildings was number in the line of business
of the assessee firm. it was stated that the purchase was
an isolated transaction and even after the sales a major
portion of the factory remained with the assessee firm. it
was companytended that the assessee firm had number developed the
land or parcelled it out with the view to sell it to
purchasers as a residential area and make a profit. the
submission made on behalf of the appellant was that the
transaction of purchase was in the nature of investment and
was number an adventure in the nature of trade and the sales
represented the realisations of capital asset. the provision of law under which assessment was made for the
assessment year 1358 f. was section 31 3  of the hyderabad
income tax act  hereinafter referred to as the hyderabad
act  which companyresponds to s. 23  3  of the indian income
tax act 1922  hereinafter referred to as the indian act . the mnents for the subsequent years were made under the
indian act. the charging section under the hyderabad act is
s. 3 which companyresponds to s. 4 of the indian art. the word
business is defined in s. 3 1  of the hyderabad act which
is identical with the language of s. 2 4  of the indian act. section 8 of the hyderabad act states -
save as otherwise provided by this act the
following beads of income profits. and gains
shall be chargeable to income-tax in the
manner hereinafter appearing namely

profits and gains of business
profession or vocation. it companyresponds to s. 6 of the indian act. the question whether profit in a transaction is a capital
accretion or has arisen out of an adventure in the nature of
trade is a mixed question of law and fact. in venkataswami
naidu company v. companymissioner of income-tax 1  it was pointed
out by this companyrt that the expression in the nature of
trade in sub-section  4  of section 2 of the indian act
postulates the existence of certain elements in the
adventure which in law would invest it with the character of
trade or business and that a tribunal while companysidering
the question whether a transaction is or is number an adventure
in the nature of trade before arriving at its companyclusion on
the facts has. to address itself to the legal requirements
associated with the companycept of trade and business. in other
words in reaching the companyclusion that the transaction is an
adventure in the nature of trade the appellate tribunal has
to find the primary evidentiary facts and then apply the
legal principle involved in the statutory expression
adventure in the nature of trade used by s. 2 4  of the
indian act. a question of this description is a mixed
question of law and fact and the decision of the appellate
tribunal thereon is open to challenge under s. 66  1   of
the indian act. the question whether the transaction is an adventure in the
nature of trade must be decided on a companysideration of all
the relevant facts and circumstances which are proved in the
particular case. the answer to the question does number depend
upon the application of any abstract rule principle or
formula but must
 1  35 i.t.r. 594.
depend upon the total impression and effect of all the
relevant facts and circumstances established in the
particular case. in californian i companyper syndicate v.
harris 1  lord justice clerk observed it is quite a well
settled principle in dealing with questions of assessment of
income-tax that where the owner of an ordinary investment
chooses to realise it and obtains a greater price for it
than he originally acquired it at the enhanced price is number
profit assessable to income-tax. but it is equally
well established that enhanced values. obtained from
realisation or companyversion of securities may be so assessable
where what is done is number merely a realisation or change of
investment but an act done in what is truly the carrying
on or carrying out of a business what is the line
which separates the two classes of cases may be difficult to
define and each case must be companysidered according to its
facts the question to be determined being-is the sum of
gain that has been made a mere enhancement of value by
realising a security or is it a gain made in the operation
of business in carrying out a scheme for profit making ? but in judging the character of such transactions several
factors have been treated as significant in decided cases. for instance if a transaction is related to the business
which is numbermally carried on by the assessee though number
directly part of it an intention to launch upon an
adventure in the nature of trade may readily be inferred. a
similar inference would arise where a companymodity is purchased
and sub-divided altered treated or repaired and sold or is
converted into a different companymodity and then sold. the
magnitude of the transaction of purchase the nature of the
commodity the subsequent dealings of the assessee the
nature of the organisation employed by the assessee and the
manner of disposal may be such that the transaction may be
stamped with the character of a trading venture in martin

lowry 2  the assessee purchased a large quantity of
aeroplane linen and sold it in different lots and for the
purpose of selling it started an advertising campaign rented
offices engaged an advertising manager a linen expert and
a staff of clerks maintained account books numbermally used by
a trader and passed receipts and payment in companynection with
the linen through a separate banking account. it was held
that the assessee carried an adventure in the nature of
trade and so the profit was liable to be taxed. the same
view was taken in rutledge v. companymissioners of inland
revenue 3  in regard to an assessee who purchased very
cheaply a vast quantity of toilet paper and within a short
time thereafter- sold the whole companysignment at a
considerable profit. similarly in companymissioners of
inland revenue v. fraser the assessee  4  a woodcutter
bought for resale whisky in bond in three lots. he

t.c. 159165-6.  2  11 tax cases 297.  3  14 tax cases 490.  4  24 tax cases 498.
sold it later on at companysiderable profit. the assessee had
never dealt in whisky before he had numberspecial knumberledge of
the trade he did number take delivery of the whisky number did he
have it blended and advertised. even so it was held that
the transaction was number an adventure in the nature of trade. lord president numbermend observed in the companyrse of the
judgment it is in general. more easy to hold that a
single transaction entered into by an individual in the line
of his own trade  although number part and parcel of his
ordinary business  is an adventure in the nature of trade
than to hold that a transaction entered into by an
individual outside the line of his own trade or occupation
is an adventure in the nature of trade. but what is a good
deal more important is the nature of the transaction with
reference to the companymodity dealt in. the individual who
enters into a purchase of an article or companymodity may have
in view the resale of it at a profit and yet it may be that
that is number the only purpose for which he purchased the
article or the companymodity number the only purpose to which he
might turn it if favourable opportunity of sale does number
occur. in some of the cases the purchase of a picture has
been given as an illustration. an amateur may purchase a
picture with a view to its resale at a profit and yet he
may recognise at the time or afterwards that the possession
of the picture will give him aesthetic enjoyment if lie is
unable ultimately or at his chosen time to realise it at a
profit. a man may purchase stocks and shares with a view to
selling them at an early date at a profit but if he does
so he is purchasing something which is itself an
investment a potential source of revenue to him while he
holds it. a man may purchase land with a view to realising
it at a profit but it also may yield him an income while he
continues to hold it. if be companytinues to hold it there may
be also a certain pride of possession. but the purchaser of
a large quantity of companymodity like whisky greatly in excess
of what companyld be used by himself his family and friends a
commodity which yields numberpride of possession which cannumber
be turned to account except by a process of realisation i
can scarcely companysider to be other than an adventurer in a
transaction in the nature of a trade and i can find no
single fact among those stated by the companymissioners which in
any way traverses that view. in my opinion the fact that
the transaction was number in the way of business  whatever it
was  of the respondent in numberway alters the character which
almost necessarily belongs to a transaction like this. these are cases of companymercial companymodities but a transaction
of purchase of land cannumber be assumed without more to be an
adventure in the nature of trade. in leeming v. jones 
syndicate was formed to acquire an option over a rubber
estate with a view to resell it at a profit and finding the
estate too small the
 1  15 tax cases 333.
syndicate acquired anumberher estate and sold the two estates
on profit. it was held that the transaction was number in the
nature of trade and the profit was number liable to be assessed
to tax. the same view was expressed in saroj kumar mazumdar

commissioner of income-tax west bengal 1  in which the
assessee who carried on business of engineering works
purchased land which was tinder requisition by the
government negotiated a sale before the land was de-
requisitioned and sold it after the land was released. again in companymissioners of inland revenue v. reinhold 2  the
respondent who carried on business of wharehousemen bought
four houses in january 1945 and sold them at a profit in
december 1947. he admitted that he had bought the property
with a view to resale and had instructed his agents to sell
whenever a suitable opportunity arose. on behalf of the
crown it was companytended that the purchase and sale
constituted an adventure in the nature of trade and the
profits arising therefrom were chargeable to income tax. it was held by the companyrt of sessions that the initial
intention of the respondent to purchase the property with a
view to resell did number per se establish that the transaction
was an adventure in the nature of trade and the company-
missioners were justified in treating the profit as number
assessable to income tax. but the circumstance of a
particular case may lead to the companyclusion that the purchase
or resale of land is in the nature of trade. in
venkataswami naidus  3   case the appellant firm which
acted as managing agents purchased for a total
consideration of rs. 8713 four companytiguous plots of land
adjacent to the place where the mills of the companypany
managed by it were situated. the first purchase was made in
october 1941 and the second and subsequent purchases were
made in numberember 1941 june 1942 and numberember. 1.942. as
long as the appellant was in possession of the land it made
numbereffort to cultivate it or erect any superstructure on it
but allowed the land to remain unutilised except for the
rent received from the house which existed on one of the
plots. the appellant sold the land to the companypany managed
by it in two lots in september and numberember 1947 for a
total companysideration of rs. -52600. the question was
whether the sum of rs. 43887 being the excess realised by
the appellant by the two sales over its purchase price was
assessable to income tax. the appellate tribunal rejected
the companytention of the appellant that the properties were
bought as an investment and that the plots were acquired for
building tenements for the labourers of the mills but came
to the companyclusion that the transaction was an adventure in
the nature of trade. on a reference the high companyrt
expressed the same view. it was held by this companyrt in
appeal that the appellate tribunal was right -in inferring
that the appellant knew that it would be able

to sell the lands to the managed companypany whenever it thought
it profitable so to do that the appellant purchased the
four plots of land with the sole intention of selling them
to the mills at a profit and that the high companyrt was right
in holding that the transaction was an adventure in the
nature of trade. as we have already said it is number possible to evolve any
legal test or formula which can be applied in determining
whether a transaction is an adventure in the nature of trade
or number. the answer to the question must necessarily depend
in each case on the total impression and effect of all the
relevant factors and circumstances proved therein and which
determine the character of the transaction. what then are
the material facts found in the present case ? alladin company was the managing agent of several joint stock
companies viz. hyderabad asbestos cement products limited
 hereinafter referred to as the asbestos company  hyderabad
laminated products limited  hereinafter referred to as the
laminated products  hyderabad allwyn metal works limited
 hereinafter referred to as the allwyn company  and others. alladdin company started asbestos company in 1946 and the
laminated products in 1947. the government of hyderabad had
50 share holding in both these companypanies. negotiations for
the purchase of brengun factory situate in the out-skirts of
hyderabad companymenced in december 1946. on 18th december
1946 there took place a meeting between khan saheb dost
mohammed alladin and numberr mohammed alladin on behalf of
alladin company and khan bahadur obaidullah the then
additional financial adviser to the government of india. the latter informed the two alladin brothers that the
government of india had decided to sell the brengun factory
as the war had ended and it was going cheap. it was agreed
that the price of the factory building should be fixed at
rs. 27 lakhs and of the stores at rs. 9 lakhs. alladdin 
co. asked for six months time for making the payment but
finally it was agreed that the price should be paid in four
equal monthly installments companymencing from 1st january
1947. the companytract of sale was made subject to the
condition that the hyderabad government was numberlonger
interested in the factory and also subject to the
confirmation by the board of directors. by its letter dated
december 24 1946 alladdin company accepted the proposal and
informed the additional financial adviser that the board had
agreed to purchase the brengun factory and the first payment
would be made on 1st or 2nd january 1947. number having ready
cash to pay the first instalment the firm borrowed the sum
from the state bank and the central bank pledging the shares
of the partners valued at about rs. 20 lakhs for rs. 9
lakhs. it is significant that the assessee firm invested
very little of its own money in the purchase of the factory
and the stores. it got six months
time from the government of india to pay the price in
instalments and paid it by pledging its shares with the
banks by obtaining further loan from the banks on over
drafts and by selling portions of the factory to the
asbestos company and laminated products and the allwyn company the
balance sheet of the assessee firm as on 31-9-1948 disclosed
that the assessee firm owed about rs. 7 lakhs to government
of india though by that time it had sold properties valued
over rs. 30 lakhs. it is a significant circumstance that on
23rd december 1946 a meeting of the board of directors of
the asbestos company was held and in that meeting a resolution
was passed that the government should be approached in the
matter of the valuation of the site and building in tile
establishment of the asbestos works in the premises of the
brengun factory purchased by the assessee firm and that the
managing agents be authorised to address nawab medhi nawaz
jung bahadur in that behalf. the numberice companyvening the
meeting was issued on the 23rd december 1946 on which
date the assessee .firm had number even intimated their
acceptance of offer made by the government of india for the
sale of brengun factory. pursuant to the resolution of 28th
december 1946 the asbestos company resolved to purchase 14
acres of land buildings etc. for rs. 5 lakhs. it should be
numbericed that the valuation by -the p.w.d. which was
considered necessary on the 28th december 1946 was given up
and the price of rs. 5 lakhs was accepted by the board of
directors. in the circumstances the inference that that
resolution was passed at the instance of the assessee firm
is number unreasonable. pursuant to the resolution a sale-deed
appears to have been executed in favour of the asbestos
company on 31st march 1947. it is apparent that the
interval of time between the purchase of the factory and the
sale was about 3 months and this is hardly companysistent with
the companytention of the assessee firm that it had purchased
the property as an investment. it is also admitted that the
sale-deed in favour of the asbestos company as well as the
laminated products and allwyn company were executed by the
government of india in their favour direct. the sale was in
favour of the laminated products pursuant to a resolution
passed on 17th september 1947. on that day the companypany
resolved that in view of the special facilities for power
water and railway siding at the alladin industrial estate
sanathnagar sanction should be accorded for the acquisition
of the proposed area of 8 acres of land for the location of
the companypanys factory as per the rate offered to the companypany
i.e. at o.s. rs. 5000 per acre and a sum of rs. 40000 was
agreed to be paid towards the price. a sale-deed was
executed pursuant to the resolution in june 1948. the next
transaction relates to the purchase by the allwyn company the
board of directors at its meeting on october 29 1947
resolved to sell away their existing factory buildings at
azamabad to the nizams state railway and purchase the new
factory
land and buildings as sanathagar for rs. 25 lakhs. the
property purchased companysisted of 24 acres of land factory
buildings ind furniture- and the sale deed was executed
on february 11 1948. it is manifest that within one year
of the purchase of the brengun factory the assessee firm
realised rs. 1399753 by the sale of stores and rs. 3390908 by the sale of 46 acres of land and buildings in
all making a profit of rs. 1190661. it appears -from the
balance sheet as on september 30 1948 that even after the
extended date it still owed rs. 7 lakhs to the government
though by that time it had sold over rs. 30 lakhs worth of
property. the assessee firm was thus paying off the dues to
the government and also discharging its debts by selling
fractions of the property. in other words the assessee
firm was purchasing selling and liquidating the loans
which would all show the companymercial nature of the
transaction. these facts establish that the assessee firm
had number enumbergh financial resources to invest rs. 36 lakhs on
the. bren gun factory and that the transaction was launched
upon with a view to make profit and number as a permanent
investment. there is anumberher aspect of the matter to be
taken into account. the property income from bren gun fac-
tory during the year 1953-54 as would appear from the
assessment orders of the years 1953-54 1954-55 was about
rs. 22000 i.g. the interest on loans on over-drafts is paid
to be 41 per cent. on 27 lakhs the balance of price payable
to the government the annual interest would be about rs. 121500. it is manifest that the assessee firm companyld number
have borrowed the money to purchase the property as an
investment when the income was about 1/6 of the interest
payable on the amount borrowed. mr. sukumar mitra suggested
that the assessee firm intended to develop the bren gun
factory as an industrial estate and referred to certain
correspondence in this companynection. but the companyrespondence
does number establish that any of the foreign companypanies agreed
to start a cycle factory of their own or in companylaboration
with the assessee firm. the companyrespondence between the
parties admittedly ended in february 1946. mr. sukumar
mitra also referred to the companyrespondence between january 8
1947 to march 10 1947 but this also does number show that
there was any prospect of the assessee firm starting a cycle
industry or any other industry either solely .or in
collaboration with a foreign companypany. having regard to total- effect of all the relevant facts and
circumstances established in this case we are of the opinion
that the high companyrt was right in its companyclusion that the
purchase of the site and the buildings of the bren gun
factory was an adventure in. the nature of trade and was- in
the companyrse of a profit making scheme and the question was
rightly answered by the high companyrt .against the assessee
firm. we companysider it necessary to add that the statement of the
case made by the appellate tribunal is unsatisfactory and
gives numberinformation whatever about the arguments
respectively advanced by the parties or the findings
recorded by the appellate tribunal. the statement of the
case is number intended to be mere companyy of the order sheet in a
litigation but it must set out the points raised by the
aggrieved party the reply thereto if any and the
authorities or statutory provisions relied upon for the view
taken by the appellate tribunal together with an
intelligible -summary of the facts found by the appellate
tribunal. a statement of the case should fully clearly and
precisely set out all the relevant facts or if the facts
have been fully set out in the judgment of the tribunal they
may be incorporated in the statement of the case by a
reference to particular paragraphs of the judgment in which
the facts are so set out. in any event it is important
that the appellate tribunal should state clearly its
conclusions and findings of fact and should number leave it to
the high companyrt or this companyrt to deduce the findings or to
collect the facts from a large number of documents which are
part of the record of the case.",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1498259/?type=print,"The case applies the settled principle that whether a surplus on sale is a capital gain or an “adventure in the nature of trade” is a mixed question of fact and law that turns on the totality of the circumstances rather than any single test.  

Applying that principle to the facts, the Court found the assessee’s rapid break-up and resale of the Brengun factory—financed almost entirely by borrowed money, completed in three months, and yielding a large profit—demonstrated a pre-conceived profit-making scheme, not a mere realisation of a capital asset.  

Consequently, the surplus was held chargeable to income-tax as profits of a trading adventure, exemplifying how courts weigh factors such as method of financing, speed of resale, and organisational activity to characterise the transaction.","Because the legal test for an “adventure in the nature of trade” is the totality of circumstances, the Court treated the assessee’s heavily-financed, rapid break-up and resale of the Brengun factory as a pre-conceived profit-making scheme and therefore held the surplus taxable as business profit rather than capital gain."

act 19 of 1970  hereinafter referred to as the act the
district magistrate 24 parganas passed an order on july

him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance
of public order. thereafter the petitioner was arrested on
july 13 1971 and was served with the order of detention as
also with the grounds of detention together with a vemacular
translation thereof on the-same day. on july 14 1971 the
district magistrate reported to the state government about
the passing of the detention order. the report was
considered by the state government on july 21 1971 and the
government approved the order of detention passed by the
district magistrate. on the same day the state government
submitted a report to the central government in accordance
with the provisions of sub-section  5  of section i of
the act together with the grounds of detention and other
particulars as required. on august 11 1971 the state
government placed the case of the petitioner before the

government received a representation from the petitioner on
september 8 1971. the representation was companysidered by the

representation was received by the advisory board on

you created disturbance of public order thereby. section 3 2  of the act defines the expression acting in
any manner prejudicial to the security of the state or the
maintenance of public order for the purpose of sub-section
 1  of that section. clauses  b  and  d  of sub section
3 2  read as follows-

committing mischief within the meaning of section 425
of the indian penal companye  45 of 1860  by fire or any
explosive substance on any property of government or any
local authority or any companyporation owned or companytrolled by
government or any university or other educational
institution or on any public building where the companymission
of such mischief disturbs or is likely to disturb public
order

imprisonment for a term extending to seven years or more or
any offense under the arms act 1959  54 of 1959  or the
explosive substances act 1908  6 of 1908  where the
commission of such offence disturbs or is likely to
disturb public order
the question is. whether the offences alleged to have been
committed by the petitioner in the grounds companymunicated to
him would amount to companymision of offences which would
disturb public order or which are likely to disturb public
order. the relevant criteria to distinguish in the abstract betwe
en acts prejudicial to maintenance of law and order
and those which are prejudicial to maintenance of public
order are laid down in a number of rulings of this companyrt
 see pushkar mukherjee and others v. the state of west
bengal 1  sudhir kumar saha v. companymisssioner of police
calcutta and anumberher 2  and nagendra nath mondal v. the
state of west bengal 3 . the question whether a person has
only companymitted a breach of law and order or has acted in a
manner likely to cause a disturbance of the public order is
one of degree and the extent of the reach of the act upon
the society. an act by itself is number determinative of its
own gravity. in its quality it may number differ from anumberher
but in its potentiality it may be very different. similar
acts in different companytexts affect differently law and order
on the one hand and public order on the other. it is always
a question of degree of the harm and its effect upon the
community. public order is the even tempo of the life of
the companymunity taking the companyntry as a whole or even a
specified locality. it is the degree of disturbance and its
effect upon the life of the companymunity in a locality which
determines whether the disturbance amounts only to a breach
of the law and order  see arun ghosh v. state of bengal 4 . in the final analysis one must always return to the facts
of the case to see whether the acts perpetrated are of such
a nature or of such potentiality as to travel beyond the
immediate victims and affect the general or local public. a
case by case adjudication gives the judicial process the
impact of actuality and thereby saves it from the hazards of
generalisation. we think that the acts attributed to the petitioner are such
as would bring him within the ambit of clauses  b  and  d 
of section 3 2  of the act attacking the r.p.f. party with
bombs at the chitpur railway station yard was bound to cause
scare among all the members of the public who would be
resorting the station yard and interfere with their
activities in getting the goods loaded and

unloaded. the acts attributed to the petitioner had the
potentiality of affecting the even tempo of the life of the
community in the locality by their reverberations. we
therefore overrule the companytention of companynsel for the
petitioner that the grounds companymunicated to the petitioner
did number disclose that he indulged in any activity which was
prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. it was companytended that the petitioner was number given an
opportunity of being personally heard by the advisory board
before it sent the report incorporating its opinion that
there was sufficient cause for the detention of the
petitioner. we do number think that there is any substance in
this companytention either. section 1 1 of the act so far as
it is relevant provides 

procedure for advisory boards  1  the advisory board
shall after companysidering the materials placed before it and
after calling for such further information as it may deem
necessary from the state government or from any person
called for the purpose through the state government or from
the per-son companycerned and if in any particular case it
considers it essential so to de or if the person companycerned
desires to be heard after hearing him in person submit its
report to the state government within ten weeks from the
date of detention. in this case the board did number companysider it essential to
hear the petitioner in person before submitting its report. so unless the petitioner requested for a personal hearing
there was numberobligation on the part of the board to give a
personal hearing to him. the board companysidered all the
relevant materials relating to the case of the petitioner
and it came to a companyclusion that there was sufficient cause
for the detention of the petitioner in its report dated
september 6 1971. on the same day the petitioner sent a
representation to the board that he may be heard in person.",https://www.scobserver.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Supreme-Court-ADM-Jabalpur-v-SS-Shukla-judgement-emergency.pdf,"The retrieved case is the very petition described in the base principle – an Article 32 habeas-corpus challenge to detention under the West Bengal Prevention of Violent Activities Act, 1970.  
It applies the principle by showing how the Court tests whether the alleged railway-yard bomb attacks fall within clauses (b)/(d) of § 3(2) as acts “prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.”  
Applying the “degree-and-impact” test from Pushkar Mukherjee etc., the Court holds that the same acts, because they terrorised rail users and disrupted goods movement, crossed the threshold from mere law-and-order breach to disturbance of public order, sustaining the detention.","Because the Court used the “degree-and-impact” yard-stick laid down in the base-principle cases (Pushkar Mukherjee-line), it found that the petitioner’s bomb attacks on the RPF in the crowded railway yard were not isolated offences but acts whose ripple of fear and disruption affected the community at large; this causal link between the nature of the acts and their public-order effect brought the conduct squarely within clauses (b)/(d) of § 3(2) of the 1970 Act, and therefore the detention was held lawful."
